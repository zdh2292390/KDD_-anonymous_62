It is a confusing tale to watch but has moments of comedic insight and a cat of well-known actors that help to make the film entertaining - if a bit of fluff.We meet English teacher Louis Ives (Paul Dano) after a prelude of daydreaming the three factors that characterize Louis  - his obsession with  classic literature of the 1920s, his untrained perception of how to relate to people (`awkward' would be a kind term), and his penchant for fantasizing about cross dressing. He is dismissed from his school `due to budget cuts' (read `having been discovered trying on a bra and being caught by the headmaster'), yet his inappropriate response is one of glee at having been given the opportunity to move to Manhattan to become a writer.Once in New York City without connections, he answers an ad for an inexpensive apartment sharing - the ad having been submitted by one very strange Henry Harrison (Kevin Kline), an older down on his heels writer and playwright who supports himself teaching college level literature and who considers himself an aristocrat, serving as an `escort' for older wealthy women.  After an uncomfortable interview Henry consents to allow Louis to be his roommate: after weighing his options Louis accepts the room in the flea infested filthy apartment and begins trying to get to know the secretive and zany Henry.Henry provides companionship for one Vivian (Marion Seldes) and eventually Louis is brought in as an `extra man' to provide companionship for one of Vivian's friends (Celia Watson).  In the meantime Louis finds work as a telephone salesman for a Green magazine, meets the pretty but unavailable Mary (Katie Holmes), begins to encounter Henry's entourage of loonies such as Henry's bearded and dirty repairman Gershon (John C. Reilly), and gives in to his urge to learn about cross-dressing by visiting a `teacher ` and finally a make-over artist who places him in the role of a `woman'.  Louis' experience with transvestism fails and alienates Henry - for a brief time.  But what this comedic episode results in is Louis' discovery of what is important - friends and family - and Henry and his entourage supply that and the changes this brings in all the characters draws the film to a close.With a cast such as this we find ourselves wanting to connect with each character - bizarre though they all are - and to a degree this occurs.  But the script is spotty and the direction is bumpy and in many ways it feels as though the film simply never gets off the ground.  Good moments: no after taste to savor.

I howled with laughter many many times during this incredibly droll film, especially at the Kline scenes. The guy has never been funnier, except maybe in Wanda. This kind of humor is probably waaay too dry for many, but if you like Wes Anderson or Jared Hess or any other off-beat, smart new writer/director, there's something for you here.I'd go so far as to compare this to Withnail And I and Death At A Funeral (the original) for its sustained yet muffled hilarity, and those are two of the funniest modern movies I know. Not all of The Extra Man is great, but most of it is, if your mind is open and your funny bone doesn't mind being tickled from various obtuse angles. I laughed more during this film than most any movie I've seen in a year or two, but then I like it dry, and this is that, to be sure.Ames' characters are both endearing and frustrating, and ring true in all their satiric excesses. I liked everyone in this, and even Reilly's campy voicework somehow fits in, particularly in the beach scene. The cross-dressing might be a little weird for some, but then weird can lead to some very unique laughs, and the scene with the Spankologist has a gorgeous moment: watch her face after their first kiss. It glows in joy and memories of much younger days and it's actually very touching, made even better by being subtle and brief.There's a lot of heart in this film, and I'm surprised more folks didn't feel it. I sure did, and think it's a minor masterpiece in its own way, especially if you know enough older people to enjoy the sly wit Ames and Pulcini/Berman share with us. I also thought the direction was pleasantly quiet and unshowy, but set up the best lines very nicely time and again. Plus, some of the scenes have something very warm and genuine about them, a real rarity in any film.Maybe I'm nuts, but I loved almost everything about The Extra Man, and think that time will treat it very kindly. It's one of a kind, and Kevin Kline shows why he's one of the great comic actors still working, classic on the level of Peter Sellers.If you don't mind a little pathos with your comedy, and like your laughs both broad and edgy, you might just find this to be a gem.", "term": "Kevin Kline is absolutely hilarious in this very sharp, smart, goofy flick", "id": "6068:1_0"}, "6069:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Even after watching the borrowed movie, I'm having a hard time describing THE EXTRA MAN.

Only after I finished watching The Extra Man, did I find out that he was in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.  I liked his character in that movie too.  Hmm...maybe Paul Dano has (to use a line uttered by his chracter Louis) a \"...strange power over people...\" like me?  I returned the movie but I am going to BUY the movie so I can watch it again to see what I missed the first time and also listen to the song \"Dandy in the Underworld\" again (and again and again) during the closing credits.I can't believe that in the year 2011, I have finally discovered some of the allure of the 70's band named \"T-Rex\" as I am now a fan.  \"Dandy in the Underworld\" played during the closing credits and I could NOT flip to the main menu like I usually do when the closing credits start scrolling.

They both find the old lady dead in her chair. At first she seems to have died of advanced cancer. But then a small discrepancy points to clever murder.In The Oxford Murders, this odd sequence happens to two others... plausible deaths then slight signs of purposeful corpse-making. Before Martin (Elijah Wood) and Seldom (John Hurt) fully realize the implications, they are joined together in a search for the serial murderer. One thing they realize soon: The murderer is almost as clever a mathematician as they are. And math, as it was nearly for me in high school, can be the death of a person.Here's what I mean: The theory of logical series, Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Bormat's (read Fermat's) Last Theorem and, of course, the divine number.

We've been hearing about that damn butterfly for decades but who has been able to predict a single hurricane? Nobody! Tell me something. Where is the beauty and harmony in cancer? What makes a cell suddenly decide to turn itself into a killer metastasis and destroy the rest of the cells in a healthy body? Does anybody know? No!

Elijah Wood and William Hurt have magnificent chemistry and give excellent performances, but the script has a lot of flab.Martin (Wood) is a young American student at Oxford who is writing his thesis; he hopes to have the famous mathematician Arthur Seldom (John Hurt) advise him... only to have his hopes dashed.But when Seldom visits the house where he is boarding, the two men find Martin's landlady dead -- and while at first it appears to be natural causes, the police discover that she was murdered. And when Seldom reveals that he was sent a strange message warning him about the murder, he and Martin begin speculating that they're dealing with an \"intellectual serial killer.\"At the same time, Martin finds himself in an odd love triangle between his landlady's neurotic daughter (Julie Cox) and a sexy Spanish nurse (Leonor Watling). But his mind is fixed on unraveling the pattern that may lead him and Seldom to the murderer -- and the greatest puzzle is one that no one may be able to figure out.Pythagorus, the principle of uncertainty, sequential math and mathematical order versus chaos. \"The Oxford Murders\" feels a bit like a mathematical episode of \"Masterpiece Theatre\" -- vast venerable colleges, the tangled motives, and some seemingly impossible murders.And the idea of murder warnings based on sequential mathematics is a fascinating one...... which becomes a problem, because we end up with endless, pompous discussions about truth, reality and philosophy. Eventually you just want to scream at Seldom, \"Get off your butt and go detect!\"&Aacute;lex de la Iglesia cloaks the movie in pale light and a bleak greyness broken by brief spatters of color, and occasionally drops in some more explosive scenes (a rather clever incident involving two buses). Unfortunately, the plot has quite a bit of flab -- Martin's romance with Lorna doesn't really add anything to the plot except a sex scene involving pasta, and his demented classmate doesn't add much more.But there is a saving grace. Wood and Hurt are absolutely magnificent together as the yin and yang of this investigation -- one is an idealistic, somewhat naive young student, and the other is an embittered, icy old man who apparently takes a weird delight in stirring others up.

This cheesy made-for-television murder mystery is one of those all-too-arrogant, in-your-face, fall-down-silly errors that usually make audiences laugh in all the wrong places. Mission accomplished.Elijah Wood plays Martin, a mathematical prodigy (you couldn't tell from seeing this) who travels to study at Oxford under the great Professor Seldom (a brilliant, diabolical John Hurt). With some compelling music and cinematography that is a direct nod to Alfred Hitchcock - NOT to Brian De Palma as is commonly misstated - this is more like bad American 1980s TV than anything else.Aside from the endlessly stupid intellectual goofs in the mathematics and physics theorems referenced in the script (Fermat's Theorem is called \"Bormat\" or \"Doormat\" or something; the number pi is confused with the lesser-known number phi), there is little to commend this thing. The usual gross-out sex scene (even worse as half of 'the team' is Elijah) angered me as per usual. Eurotrash at its finest: with the help of a once-admired American falling star.What is saddest of all is the story is quite compelling, the villains are actually numerous - and not entirely evil. The real villain(s) will never be quite whom you suspect. One villain is idiotically exposed at the beginning of the film, but it doesn't end with her. What I think is wonderful is the question this movie puts to us: is crime and villainy a driven act of desperation on the part of an otherwise innocent person?As a murder mystery and as Anglophile-bait, it's mediocre. As a general film it is all too reminiscent of shows such as \"Foyle's War\" (believe it or not), \"NCIS\" and \"NUMB3RS\". It takes too many cues from other silly things such as THE DAVINCI CODE. The London Police cooperating fully with, even relying on, a weirdo student and a math professor in a major crime series? An American nobody kid allowed free run and access to crime scene photos? Are they kidding me??Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons were both offered the role of Professor Seldom, and wisely refused. John Hurt can always afford to dumpster-dive in a thing like this and take it in his stride; Elijah Wood cannot, and this is one of a string of proofs that Wood's career is finished. A solid ten minutes of absolute yuck sex between Elijah and a buxom beauty (just to remind us how straight he is) - that is the red flag of the ages.

It is a cerebral exercise in logic and mathematical theory in addition to being a clever murder mystery heavily bent toward the thinking viewer.Martin (Elijah Wood) arrives at Oxford form his trailer house home in Arizona to study with the brilliant mathematics professor Arthur Seldom (John Hurt).  He brings little with him as he settles in with roommate Yuri Podorov (Burn Gorman) who clearly has a loathing for Seldom and for all of the great minds that have apparently stolen his solution for a theory. His elderly and physically impaired landlady Mrs. Eagleton (Anna Massey), who worked on the infamous Enigma Code that saved England in WW II, warmly accepts Martin into her home, introduces him to her daughter Beth (Julie Cox) who makes it clear that the old lady is preventing Beth from having the life of a free person, a cellist who wants more from life than confinement as a caregiver.  Martin discovers that Seldom is not available to take on new postgrad students, and Martin challenges Seldom in a large classroom as Seldom is declaring Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory that there is no real truth.  That challenge begins a bond between the two and when they individually meet at Mrs. Eagleton's home and find her murdered, Seldom shares a strange note left in his mailbox indicating the murder is the first of a series linked by a mysterious pattern. This new clue introduces the possibility of a code-guided threat of a serial killer and indeed more murders occur, each victim on the surface appearing to die of natural causes, but each paired with a message bearing a new arcane symbol. Seldom and Martin work together to break the code and to discover whether the deaths are innocent or the subtle, \"imperceptible\" homicides of a psychotic killer seeking to match wits with the great logician.  They work with the policeman Inspector Petersen (Jim Carter) and the hunt is on.  There are plenty of sidebars to lead them astray - both from the truth of the code and from personal needs: Martin becomes physically involved with Lorna (Leonor Watling) who has been Seldom's girlfriend in the past, and with Beth to no great end, and Seldom finds a suspicious father of a child in need of lung transplants.  The ending of the story is completely surprising - another code we have failed to break in the course of this intellectual thriller.Elijah Wood and John Hurt have superb screen chemistry and maintain our interest and concern throughout the film.

It truly hinders when trying to tell a story where you have to make things palatable for the masses trying to entertain while at the same time discussing topics that perhaps the majority of them have no interest in. This becomes the biggest problem with THE OXFORD MURDERS.The movie tells the story of Martin (Elijah Wood), a young man who desperately wants to study philosophy with the predominate author in the field, Arthur Seldom (John Hurt), now at Oxford. The problem is getting to even speak with Seldom let alone have him be mentor for your grad thesis.But Martin has an in by staying at the home of a woman named Mrs. Eagleton (Anna Massey) who once was friends with Seldom and her daughter Beth (Julie Cox). The love/hate relationship between the two makes Martin a tad uncomfortable but he gets by, listening to his landlady's stories and trying to know more about Seldom.At a conference where Seldom is discussing his views on philosophy, Martin raises a question which follows with Seldom putting him in his place. Afterwards both turn up at the residence of Mrs. Eagleton, Martin going home and Seldom to pay her a visit after receiving a note instructing him to go there. What they find is the landlady/friend murdered.Thus begins a teaming of the two as they attempt to use their own methods of discussing philosophy and the meaning of life to determine who the murderer is. Unfortunately for much of the movie the viewer sympathizes more with the chief detective on the case Inspector Peterson (Jim Carter) than they do the philosophical duo. Listening to their wordplay does little to clarify the situation but instead confused more issues that either do or do not connect with the case at hand.Along the way Martin falls for a young woman he meets on a squash court, Lorna (Leonor Watling). At first explaining his theories and computations to determine strategy for the game, the two meet for a weekly game but eventually become enamored of one another. It isn't until later that Martin discovers that Lorna was once involved with Seldom.Clues to the identity of the murderer continue to pop up, mostly in the form of notes that he leaves behind as he alters from a simple murder to a serial killer. Each note posts a figure that the discussions of philosophy used to determine what the next symbol will be which in turn will lead them to who is doing the deeds and where he will strike next. The problem is that we're watching as two great minds discuss what would apparently be simple things they would understand in an attempt to explain things to us but at the same time explaining things that most of us won't get.So does that make this a bad movie? Not really. To begin with it is extremely well made with fantastic cinematography and acting that truly makes each and every character believable. And the base story itself, the murder that does indeed get solved by the end of the film is one that uses plot twists and skullduggery to make those seeking the truth go this way and that trying to follow each clue. Even the discussions of philosophy can become interesting at times, though they feel out of place when the whole idea of catching a serial killer is in question.Perhaps the movie tries too much, combining these two elements (murder mystery and philosophy) to little effect for either one. A film like MY DINNER WITH ANDRE showed that two people sitting and having a discussion over dinner could make for entertainment. Here it just feels like we have to emotionally detached loners more interested in impressing one another than in actually discovering whodunit.Its not that this movie doesn't entertain at all, but it makes the viewer work far more than one would expect for a murder mystery and not in the form of solving the murder. Instead it makes you consider the thoughts and theories being discussed around the murder and then try to apply them to solving the case much as the pair attempt. At most it is enlightening, at worst a muddled mess.Is it worth a rental? I'd have to say yes. It might not be one to add to your collection though.

It graduates from the merely pedantic to the completely far-fetched. Like the book, it posits a serial killer who is playing abstruse mathematical games with Professor Seldom and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; at Oxford's Mathematical Institute. However, the film throws in all sorts of extra glancing mathematical references - to Fermat's Last Theorem, to Fibonacci's series, and to chaos theory. A lot of these references don't exist in the book or else are more integral aspects of the book. So the movie is like a Koosh ball, sprouting all sorts of alien little rubbery protrusions that make it briefly tantalizing, but that ultimately just cause it to come off as silly.The movie reminds me of Tom Stoppard's play \"Arcadia.\" While that play was acclaimed, when you thought about it logically, you realized that all its talk about chaos theory was completely adventitious and unnecessary.There are other problems with this movie. Scenes that were treated more realistically in the book become grotesqueries in the movie. The film tries to combine the most garish elements of \"The DaVinci Code,\" a CSI episode, and \"The Zodiac Killer.\"Whereas in the book, the protagonist's Russian roommate is just a normal person, in the movie he is portrayed by an actor who inexplicably chews up the scenery like a rabid dog. In the book, Seldom's former eccentric, obsessed colleague is indeed a hopeless case in the extended care ward of a hospital; but in the movie the man is presented as a shocking mutilation of a figure. In the book, Seldom is an average-looking 50-year-old professor; in the movie he is played by John Hurt whose already world-weary face is photographed as ravaged superannuation. The book's brief, innocent sex scenes become rawly carnal in the film. In the book, inappropriate romances that are barely suggested or suspected are made explicit and decisive in the film. The film also adds a further twist ending to the solution of the murders that is sort of interesting and integrating, but that ultimately makes a triangle with 190 degrees of all the antecedent action.Not that the book is perfect.

She is familiar with his work and writes murder mysteries.Crazy guy- He believes Jesus came back to revenge his death. He is clearly unbalanced.

The pace is slower, however, and the film's \"truth\" is more unbelievable than what Robert Langdon finds out.Actually, implausible storyline is not a bad thing as long as it keeps us entertained, but philosophical discourse and occasional discussion about cryptic symbols are not enough to make a film interesting.

Given, it's not as if the world were clamoring for more cop procedural shows. But, A&E;, did you have to cut the throat without resolving the Season 4 cliffhanger ending? And, okay, given, ain't much that's original about The Glades. Oh, the setting is sumptuous. Florida always did provide the lush, sun-drenched visuals. But the formulaic mystery-of-the-week certainly wasn't the gravitating element. The primary hook was Matt Passmore, an Aussie affecting a credible Yank accent. He played Jim Longworth, formerly Chicago PD except he had to beat feet out of the Windy City, scandal in his wake, the captain's bullet in his butt.His fresh start is the fictional Palm Glade, FL. And he's still solving homicides, this time under the auspices of the FDLE (Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement). The premiere episode started off trite, ended up like gangbusters in the sense that it dropped a really tasty twist that made me want to see the second and third and fourth episode. But, no lie, watching the first few minutes of episode one, I wasn't feelin' it. Jim Longworth came off as smirky and snarky and obnoxious, and it took a minute to warm up to him. But his supporting cast had flavor, from his laid back forensic pathologist pal Carlos (Carlos Gomez) to the smart and sassy nurse/single mom Callie (Kiele Sanchez) whom Longworth runs into and right away fancies.The crackling chemistry between Kiele and Passmore is the engine that drives the show. The impression Longworth leaves is that he's this self-contained dude, so it was nice to see him sort of obsessing over someone. You get the sense that Kiele Sanchez is a very capable actress who's likeable in whatever role she sinks her teeth into. Her Callie is a strong woman. She's not averse to putting Longworth in the friend zone. Her scruples won't allow her to push it beyond that. Callie's husband is currently in stir, and, as she confides to Longworth, she doesn't want to be one of those women who divorced their husbands while they were in prison. So, me, I was blas&eacute; about the corpse of the week. What I craved - and eventually got - was more development between Longworth and Callie.The Glades exudes a whiff of Carl Hiaasen. It's like CSI: Miami less the concentration on forensics and the wardrobe is a wee bit more relaxed. When Longworth and Callie aren't bringing the sizzle, the show is smart enough to partner Longworth up with Carlos, and their amusing interplay is always fun to watch. For me, one detracting element is young Uriah Shelton who plays Callie's 12-year-old son. I'm trying not to blame the actor as I think it's the scripts that call for him to be bratty and vexing. Jeff is really the main obstacle to Longworth and Callie's taking it to the next level. The kid pines for his incarcerated dad to get with his mom again. This whole mess is a running sub-plot thru most of the life of the series.My favorite Season 1 eps:- \"Pilot\" for that very unexpected twist- \"A Perfect Storm\" in which Longworth must solve a killing spree and attend a high school reunion (not his own) as a hurricane slams into Palm Glade- \"Honey\" mostly for Longworth's temporary partner, the muy sexy tribal police officer, Josie Tigertail (Morgan Hewitt)Ultimately, whether you're down with The Glades depends on your take on Matt Passmore. Yes, his character is maddening and brash and frequently so callous. Longworth does possess mad investigative skills, but he's a maverick. His method of choice is pretty much poking that beehive to get a reaction. Longworth's saving grace, what makes him finally sympathetic, is that he genuinely cares for Callie. And everything goes from there. The Glades isn't the best crime drama. But I like its quirk and I really like the girl and I like eyeballing the bright splash of Floridian backdrop. But, man, that Season 4 cliffhanger kills me. We'll never know. It's like Now & Again, Space: Above & Beyond, the 1990's Spider-Man cartoon, and Popular all over again.

He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives.

The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly.

You can't turn the dial without hitting some form of CSI or NCIS or L&O; or one of their lighthearted cable cousins.  So when \"The Glades\" popped up on the A&E;, I was pretty hesitant about giving it a shot.  It definitely falls into the comic caper category popularized by the USA network or TNT in too many shows to enumerate.  But I'll be darned if it just doesn't work here as well for two primary reasons.  First, the locales within the Florida glades provides some pretty scenic areas for bodies to be dumped.  In fact, the opening segments are usually quite well done and kick off each episode's mystery with a visual flair.  But second, and most important, is the star making turn by a very charming Matt Passmore.  As a Chicago cop relocated to a small local police force, Passmore hits all the right notes.  With humor and intelligence, he cracks the cases as he cracks wise--but his verbal banter is genuinely amusing and not overly precious.As with most procedurals, oftentimes the case solutions are fairly obvious or secondary to the journey of arriving at the finale.  Most of the drama and comedy comes from Passmore interacting with the suspects as well as his team.  He enjoys an easy chemistry with Carlos Gomez as his primary confidante and the two play off each other well.  Of course, the show provides a requisite love interest.  Kiele Sanchez plays a local med student raising a son alone while the boy's father is locked up.  Sanchez has a genuine appeal and starts off the season as a terrific romantic foil.  Passmore plays the surrogate father, naturally, and this element can be overplayed at times--but, for the most part, it works.  The initial banter between Sanchez and Passmore has real heat and fire.  As obvious as they seem as a couple, though, the program tries to interject additional drama with Sanchez's jailbird ex.But as much as I like Sanchez as an actress, her character provides the most challenging aspect of \"The Glades.\"  After a few episodes, the show becomes increasingly strained trying to incorporate her character into the main action.  Passmore often consults with her on matters that, in reality, he would not.  She is knowledgeable in whatever random plot device is needed any given week--be it horses or pirate treasure or local politics.  I really don't think this random medical student would be the police department's number one contact.  And to keep things lively, the show presents a push/pull dynamic in their courtship that is less organic than it should be--it just makes her seem extremely wishy washy and high maintenance.  Luckily, she is so strong in the beginning that I overlooked some of her character inconsistencies.  Look, this is basically a show in which to have fun.  As lighthearted entertainment, it certainly succeeds.  I found Passmore genuinely funny and that's enough for me to make a recommendation.  Try it out, you might like it!

For instance the characters in both VEGAS and LAS VEGAS never seem to run into the folks at CSI. I wondered this as I watched season one of THE GLADES. It would be interesting to witness the intensity of David Caruso as he came up against the smart aleck attitude of GLADES' Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore).Longworth is a transported Chicagoan who came to a town in Florida for health reasons: caught sleeping with someone he shouldn't have been, he could have ended up dead had he stayed in the windy city. As a homicide detective he gets his chance to see enough dead bodies without having to worry one is his own.The character of Longworth is an endearing one. He jokes and cracks wise at crime scenes while at the same time taking note of everything around him. Those finite pieces of information that others glance over are noted by him as he solves murders most would have difficulty with.Along side Longworth are two police characters that provide a yin and yang for him. Carlos Sanchez (played by Carlos Gomez) is a coroner who helps Jim along not just in the field but as a friend as well. The two may give each other a hard time but they definitely work well together. The second is Colleen Manus (Michelle Hurd), a tough cop who is Jim's supervisor intent on keeping a tight reign on him until he proves himself.While Longworth is out fighting crime and searching for killers each week, we also get drawn into the story of his love life as it is. He meets a young nurse named Callie Cargill (Kiele Sanchez) and they seem to get along. His boyish charm and wise cracks break the frozen barrier she starts with and they become friends first. It seems that Callie has a husband who's currently in jail but whom she wants to break with. The biggest reason she doesn't is her son Jeff (Uriah Shelton). As the show moves forward, Jeff and Jim become close, but there's still that fondness for his real father that keeps Jeff at bay.Each episode features a new crime to solve, a new murder done by various criminals. Some are accidental, some well thought out in advance, all are solved before the final minutes of each show. The clues are laid out for viewers to try and guess the ending, as most murder mystery TV shows go. But the thing that makes this show different than most is the characters.These are characters that you develop a liking towards. Each of them, even the hard as nails supervisor Longworth answers to. They each have their own strengths and weaknesses and that helps to make them more believable and more endearing. You want these two men to be close friends, you want Jim and Callie to get together. Now it's just watching and waiting for those things to happen as well as to see how the crime is solved.One thing I've noticed over the past few years. Some of the best TV series coming out are found on the cable networks as opposed to the big three. Which says a lot about how things have changed over the years. The three main networks are no longer the home for the best there is on TV. This show is proof of that.With the new season already started, this DVD set is the perfect way to get caught up and find out how it all began. Forget about renting this one, it's a series that's worth investing in to keep. The acting is great, the cinematography is well done and each episode features some great writing and directing.

So she decides to stay in Haven, and partners up with local cop Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryan) to solve local crimes while she searches for hints to her past.However, it turns out that the \"troubles\" are returning to Haven after thirty-ish years -- mysterious aging, outbreaks of madness and sanity, spontaneously rotting food, horrible deaths related to artwork, a shadowy \"Dark Man\" (no, not the one Stephen King fans are thinking of!), a deadly shapeshifter, fiery deaths, a poltergeist and countless ground cracks.\"Haven Season 1\" takes a little time to bloom. At first the acting is stiff, the one-off plots are ordinary, and there's no strong overarcing plot except \"the troubles are back!\" But as time goes by, the stories get darker and the writing becomes more compelling -- especially since only some of the mysteries center around stuff you can arrest people for.Each episode introduces a new bizarre occurrence, and has Nathan and Audrey trying to unravel whose powers are going out of control. These mysteries are fairly clever, and there are some funny moments sprinkled in every episode (\"I need a HUUUUUGG!\"). And despite being based on a King novel, most of it isn't horrifying -- there are some creepy moments, such as a poor guy's eyes, ears and mouth slowly sealing up before our eyes. Eww.Emily Rose is kind of stiff in the first few episodes, but she becomes a really likable heroine by the halfway point of the series -- she's strong, compassionate, playful and has some shocking secrets of her own. Bryan plays Nathan as reclusive and quiet, mainly because he can't physically feel anything. And there are some solid side performances by Eric Balfour as a charming smuggler, Nicholas Campbell as the gruff sheriff, and Anne Caillon as Nathan's girlfriend.\"Haven\" hasn't fully unfolded into the great show it might become, but the first season shows it starting to really bloom -- and leaves you wanting more.", "term": "Small town troubles", "id": "6292:1_0"}, "6293:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "First met this show in an online preview of Episode One at a nameless competitor.

Camped in Lunenburg this summer up the street from where the Bluenose II is being rebuilt and walked the harbour where Duke's boat lies docked with a for sale sign. Town Hall subs as the police station.Those personal attachments aside the series employs great Canadian actors the two male leads being standouts. Anyone who has gone down to the sea in ships knows that superstition and faith take over when man loses control and despite the most advanced technology man is still powerless to control the sea. Half-million ton ships still plow straight into rogue waves off the Cape of Good Hope and vanish forever. Ships like the Mary Celeste show up sailing themselves with crews that vanished without a trace. Among people who try to make sense of the inexplicable ghosts and hauntings are commonplace. Some of the storylines here begin to strain suspension of disbelief but on the whole are not too far removed from reality. The episode in Season 2 based on the plagues of Egypt taken from Exodus is a case in point. Highly recommended. If it succeeds this show should do wonders for tourism in a World Heritage Community.

Smokin' hot FBI agent. Yeah, count me in. I'm not sayin' HAVEN is the best show on television, but it's certainly kept me tuning in. HAVEN draws its roots from Stephen King's novella, THE COLORADO KID, and the ironic bit is that this novella has closer ties to the mystery genre than to horror fiction.Cracks on the road, holes in her past. Deployed to Haven, Maine on a routine investigation, FBI agent Audrey Parker stumbles onto sudden fissures on the road and onto the puzzle of the Colorado Kid, an unsolved, decades-old mystery which may or may not shed light on her murky orphaned past. Agent Parker is intrigued enough and hopeful enough that she opts to bide a while in Haven. She rapidly susses out that this little town hides its fair share of secrets. What makes Haven special is its status as refuge for those with paranormal attributes. The townspeople, in hushed tones, label those with extraordinary abilities as \"Troubled\" or \"Afflicted.\" Sometime in the past, a plague of supernatural horror - or the Troubles - swept over Haven, and then eventually went away. Today, dormant powers are reviving; there's a strangeness in the air. the Troubles are back. And Agent Parker, with her training and her natural bump of curiousity, may just be Haven's best hope.The picturesque seaside locations - mostly shot in Nova Scotia - lend texture to the show, serve as an effective counterpoint to the town's dark underbelly. The Troubles are a widely accepted urban legend in Haven, and you often have characters dropping remarks such as \"It's the Troubles, isn't it?\" or \"The Troubles are back, aren't they?\" or in Audrey Parker's case, \"The FBI never trained you for the Troubles.\" Season One unveils thirteen episodes which are predominantly stand-alone stories, although recurring sub-plots and themes do run thru the entire season. In the unraveling of Haven's mysteries, Agent Parker regularly comes face to face with otherworldy phenomena, and she's open-minded enough and thinks outside of the box enough that she doesn't get too much ruffled, even though the foul play involved is often of the staggeringly preposterous sort. I don't know that Emily Rose makes for an entirely convincing detective - she's a bit too pretty and glib and breezy - but damn if you don't get drawn into her exploits. Emily Rose is a capable enough actress that she sells her moments of vulnerability, and then there's her intriguing chemistry with Lucas Bryant.Bryant plays Nathan Wuornos, a local cop who becomes Audrey's partner. Nathan is one of them wounded souls. He's afflicted with idiopathic neuropathy, a condition that prevents him from physically feeling anything. As one may expect, this has made Nathan a detached, almost painfully shy character. Except that he's very sympatico with Audrey Parker. And matchmakers that we are, we start hoping for them to hook up. Now if only that charming rogue and smuggler Duke Crocker (Eric Balfour) would beat feet... He's threatening to steal Nathan's thunder.When not wallowing in flirtatious moments, HAVEN dives right back into the supernatural procedural. There are some really nifty episodes featuring phenomena such as rapid aging, dream murders, a homicidal shadow, living stuffed people, a person whose moods influence the weather, shapeshifters, a pyrokinetic, an artist whose drawings affect reality, et cetera... not to mention, an assortment of folks sporting ominous tattoos. All of these crazy bits of hoodoo, by the way, are given life by - for television - pretty excellent special effects. I like that Agent Parker, often times, resolves a case without resorting to violence. On the other hand, the way she handles the unrepentant pyrokinetic demonstrates a certain ruthless streak on her part (in \"The Hand You're Dealt\"). If you're a Nathan fan, then \"As You Were\" showcases him saving the day. If you're a Duke fan, what the hell's your problem?Season One is chary with the reveals but we are treated to several big ones, with Audrey, Nathan, and Duke each either unveiling or discovering a huge secret about themselves. Nathan's discovery would make him even more attached to Audrey, the poor sap. For Audrey, curious orphan, it's all about her digging into her blurry past, her search galvanized by a mysterious photograph shown her by those two odd newspapermen when she first arrived at Haven. What she learns in the Season One finale is a humdinger and nicely dovetails into the startling season ending cliffhanger. Favorite episodes are: \"Welcome to Haven\" (the pilot); \"As You Were\" (basically a taut \"killer-in-the-midst-while-trapped-in-a-confined-space\" murder mystery; \"Sketchy,\" because how can you not love an episode in which a guy gets his limbs brutally twisted like pretzels and another bloke has his eyes and mouth cold vanish on him?; and \"Spiral\" - the very good season ender in which several plot threads come together. Now, in Season Two, if they can only escalate things a bit further and maybe develop these Troubled incidents so that they feed into a more cohesive overarching threat, why, that wouldn't suck at all. HAVEN's biggest problem is that it's harder to connect to the stories when the format insists on these creature-of-the-week stand-alone episodes. And, in fact, \"Spiral\" does a good job of changing the status quo. So, again, HAVEN may not be the best show on television. But, damn, you cannot keep me away from watching it week after week after week.HAVEN - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON contains all 13 episodes on 4 discs, with the following bonus stuff:- 12 Audio Commentaries with the cast & crew on 10 episodes, and it's a treat that the lead actor, Emily Rose, is very prominent in these commentaries- \"Welcome to Haven\" featurette (00:18:11 minutes long)- \"Visual FX of Haven\" featurette (00:05:05 minutes)- \"Mythology of Haven\" featurette, and how the writers' being inspired by Stephen King's works  ties into it (00:05:58)- 6 Behind-the-Scenes Video Blogs: \"What is Haven to You?\" - the cast's reflections on HAVEN (00:4:26); \"Let the Good Times Roll...\" - Emily Rose guides you thru the making of the giant rolling ball scene in the \"Butterfly\" episode (00:03:58); \"Location, Location,Location\" - Emily Rose guides you to several scenic spots in Nova Scotia that were shot for the show (00:01:53); \"Emily Rose Q & A (00:03:21); \"Stephen King References in the episode \"Spiral\" - which, in retrospect, aren't that many (00:03:08); and \"Sci Fi Wire Interview with Emily Rose (00:02:18)- Cast Interviews: Emily Rose (00:02:31); Lucas Bryant (00:02:08); and Eric Balfour (00:01:57)- Season 1 trailer- Season 2 Sneak Peek: Inside the Writers' Room (00:04:46)", "term": "Every town's got a few skeletons in the closet, but this closet holds an entire cemetery.", "id": "6296:1_0"}, "6297:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "first, this series is filmed in Nova Scotia (Eastern Canada), and the town setting is in Haven, Maine, in a small, quaint, fishing village.

A lot of Syfy's original shows are way out there, but Haven is more grounded and has quickly amassed a cult following. While there are similarities to the book and other King works are referenced, the show is surprisingly original.Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is an FBI agent, who gets a tip that one of her fugitives has been spotted in the small town of Haven Maine. Parker is a terrific agent, because she knows nothing of who she is or where she came from. This beautiful, but introverted girl has put everything into her work and it has become her whole life. Once she gets to Haven, she realizes that something about this town isn't quite right, but she has no idea what she's in store for.During her investigation, Parker meets two brothers who have run the towns newspaper for 40 years. These brother show Parker some old stories from a unsolved case 25 years earlier, the murder of the Colorado Kid. Why would Audry care about it you ask, well there is a photo in the paper, showing a woman at the crime scene who could pass for her twin.With the chance to discover who she is and where she came from Parker takes a leave of absence from the FBI and joins the Haven P.D. only to discover that the town and it's people are afflicted with something known as the troubles. These troubled people, for some unknown reason, have ailments that allow them to do the seemingly impossible, such as shape-shifting, destruction with a thought, murder by shadow, the ability to star fires, even an artist who control things simply by drawing them.Parker is paired with the towns only Detective, Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryant) who himself is a troubled person. His affliction is that he can't feel anything, an adaptation of a real disease in which people can't feel pain, Wuornos can't feel a thing. Together Parker and Wuornos investigate these troubles, trying to find out what's causing them, while at the same time, Audry tries to solve the Colorado Kid case in the hopes that she might one day find out who she is and where she comes from.This show is fantastic and it's not just about the Science Fiction mystery that I love so much. The troubles are a big part of it, but there is also a great mystery to the whole thing, that is really left to the audience to figure out along with Audrey. The show is further boosted by the small town element, as Haven is one of these quaint towns, where everyone knows everyone else. It makes for some fabulous recurring guests, side stories, and the occasional hilarious moment.Emily Rose is out of this world! She has always had bit parts in TV series here and there, but she's never been a star before, but when it comes to Haven she is truly the perfect one to play Audrey Parker. She brings such a different personality to a sci-fi/cop show and the way the mystery and troubles follow her really draws the audience in.Lucas Bryant is just as interesting as we try to figure out what draws this man into this work. Sure he's trouble, but his lack of feeling has left him emotionless. At times it seems like he's doing a job he doesn't want to do, but for some reason has to.The only other regular cast member is Eric Balfour who at the ripe age of 37 is a Science Fiction veteran. Balfour has done a ton of Sci-Fi, but finds himself in a different role in Haven. Balfour plays Duke Crocker, a petty criminal and smuggler, with a terrific sense of humor, who always seems to get caught up in these troubles cases.Haven is amazing, it's just one of these addictive shows that draws you in right from the very first episode. The writing makes you feel like you're riding along in your hometown, trying to figure out the mystery along side the two detectives. Every episode is better than the one before it and it's just one of those shows you never want to stop watching.

Very loosely based on the novel \"The Colorado Kid\" by Steven King, Haven is a program with an atmosphere of mystery, where you are never quite sure what may occur.  Woven into the events of various episodes are hints of hidden secrets, and indications that some bigger master plan is in motion.  The plot is convoluted, so viewing the episodes in order is highly recommended.After going through some stressful times, FBI agent Audrey Parker is sent by her boss agent Howard (Maurice Dean Wint), to the town of Haven, Maine, to investigate the death of an escaped prisoner.  On the way to Haven she is introduced to \"the troubles\", weird paranormal forces and events, that the town is known for.  The city girl experiences some problems with being accepted by the locals, but manages to affiliate herself with the local police department, headed by Chief Garland Wuornos (Nicholas Campbell), and his son Nathan (Lucas Bryant), who does not feel pain.  Nathan and Audrey become partners, and begin to investigate further manifestations of \"the troubles\".Audrey Parker's past becomes an ongoing mystery.  She is an orphan who never knew her mother, and is intrigued when she finds a newspaper article with a photograph of a woman named Lucy, who looks quite like her.  The title of the article is \"Who Killed the Colorado Kid?\"  After an unexpected fall into the water, Audrey is rescued by Duke Crocker (Eric Balfour).  Crocker runs a restaurant, lives aboard a boat, and apparently has some connection with the mysterious Lucy.  Audrey's interest in discovering more about her nebulous past, and pressure from agent Howard , leads to her resigning from the FBI, and joining the Haven police force.The stories usually feature some whacky supernatural phenomena.  If you are looking for a CSI type police procedural, you may be somewhat disappointed.  In the episode \"Sketchy\", drawings of a real person or place, have the power to physically affect that real object.  When a portrait falls into the water and sinks to the bottom, the person in the drawing drowns.  In \"Fur\", members of the local hunting club are dying, apparently killed by attacking animals that appear to be stuffed.  The strange events seem to be tied to a local taxidermist.Season One Episode list:1.  Welcome To Haven (7/9/10)2.  Butterfly (7/16/10)3.  Harmony (7/23/10)4.  Consumed (7/30/10)5.

As Haven has been renewed for a second season, we can hopefully look forward to seeing the master plan unfold, and some key questions being answered.  With a quaint rural setting and slower pace, Haven may not be very trendy, but it's a series that usually keeps you engaged, while delivering some unpredictable results.  Emily Rose does a competent job carrying the series, as her character rolls with the supernatural punches, while trying to discover more about her past.  Audrey, Nathan, and Duke, have a dynamic evolving relationship, that has yet to be settled.  Haven is a town with many mysteries, and there is potential for more revelations, but will we ever know who killed the Colorado kid?

It follows a team of people investigating real or perceived paranormal phenomena, from UFOs and ghosts to mermaids and (surprise) the Honey Island Swamp Monster. The team attempts to re-enact various \"paranormal\" scenarios to see if they really lack a mundane explanation. The whole thing reminds me of \"Finding Bigfoot\", but with a broader scope. And yes, the women on this show more skin than the BRFO's tomboy Ranae...Somewhat surprisingly, \"Fact or Faked\" takes a mostly sceptical angle on the problems under investigation. My favourite is the debunking of the bizarre urban legend about ghost children in Texas pushing cars up a slope. The team finds out that even school buses (!) are being \"pushed\" up the slope at the place in question...but unfortunately the whole thing is an optical illusion. It's really a downslope!Another classic is the debunking of \"Dr. Jonathan Reed\", who claims that his Golden Retriever was killed by a crazy alien in the Cascade Mountains. The alien had an obelisk-shaped craft. Reed killed the intruder, took the body to his cabin but lost all evidence during a burglary. Conclusion? About as fake as you can possibly get! I admit that I didn't like the debunking of the poor old Honey Island Swamp Monster, though. I mean, I happen to believe in such stuff. But perhaps there is hope after all, since \"Fact or Faked\" haven't been able to explain the mysterious Nightcrawler of Fresno. But sure, I suppose it could be a hungry shorebird looking for the closest fast food place!Despite the mostly sceptical angle, not everyone is pleased with the paranormal files. Both the CSI and the James Randi Educational Foundation have published a highly critical review of the series. It seems \"Fact or Faked\" don't rule out *all* paranormal phenomena, and occasionally makes a few gaffes. Orb spider, anyone? So while true believers might think an Illuminati plot is behind this one, the sceptical community see it as yet another paranormal \"fifth column\". Pseudo-sceptics fighting pseudo-sceptics? Will the real sceptic please stand up, LOL! As C.S. Lewis would say: \"Really, we are hard to please\"...Personally, I think \"Fact or Faked\" is somewhat uneven, with some episodes being pretty boring, while others are more interesting, even intriguing.

There are a handful of helpers who all claim dubious levels of skill - a photographer who knows nothing about post-production, a \"lead scientist\" who builds puppets on pulleys, and a \"stunt expert\" who seems to be Ben's friend from high school. Each week they show us a bunch of videos and decide on the best two to investigate, presumably more controlled by SyFy's travel budget and how crazy the witnesses are. There's one woman on the team who's video everyone hates each week, and there seems to be a growing animosity there - which is great for TV.Almost all the ghost and UFO videos are faked, or light distortions, or compression artifacts, or parallex effects, or out of focus plants rather than black-eyed children, little green men or the last part of Mel Gibson's career trying to get on film. The debunking looks promising in the first episode, and they successfully managed to explain the \"ghost car\" video that practically everyone in the whole world has seen. Then it starts to go south from there. Really far south.Whenever a case can't be immediately debunked and they're not in the business to call the hoaxer's liar, they wheel out a \"voice stress analysis\" to conclude that \"they're telling the truth\". Presumably Ben learned this from his 15 minutes at Langley. Next, they exhausted any attempt to recreate the video, usually involving unsuccessfully reflecting things off of glass or the \"scientist\" building scary-looking puppets and call it an 'experiment'. In one case, a UFO turned out to be a balloon that the park ranger reported, making the family who caught the aliens on tape seem genetically not too distant from the parents of Balloon Boy.Finally, you guessed it, they veer off into Destination Truth territory, when they start absolutely inexplicably wondering around open fields with infrared cameras at night. What this has to do with the cases is completely beyond me. In one case where they're trying to find two creatures in a man's yard in Fresno (hey, at least it's not Temecula) they somehow end up in a field and find two living things on the infrared. Holy hell, is it a deer?! Who knows, but the lead scientist draws all sorts of conclusions about Bambi that should have us getting a restraining order keeping him at least a mile from any form of laboratory.In another 'run around the fields' moment to debunk lights in the Arizona sky, they end up witnessing a shooting star/plane/satellite and are on the verge of announcing War of the Worlds and calling the Prez. Wow. Then there are conviction-filled statements - \"It's definitely a UFO\" - which then get deflated when the confidence evaporates - \"er, in that it's unidentified and flying\". And an object, sure.In yet another one - and this is my favorite - batteries start failing on equipment. Camera equipment, walkie talkies - everything except the camera that's filming of course. So our lead scientist whips out an EMF meter and metal detector, and then the metal detector fails and the EMF becomes a WTF meter as credibility jumps straight out of the window. I have no idea what they're trying to prove with any of this equipment, but they should know that if you're going for a night shoot on SyFy's dime, you could at least charge up your stuff before you get there.Ben Hansen - and you heard it here first - is the next Fox Mulder, but with even less charisma!", "term": "The FBI gets involved with ghost hunting", "id": "6337:1_0"}, "6338:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "Fact or Faked is a show about 6 people brought together to check out clips or photos of the unexplained, and go investigating whether it's genuine, or a hoax.

It seems every time, without fail, whenever a bunch of video cameras are set up and left unattended, one of them goes blank, or the tripod falls over. This was repeated far too many times for credibility, especially the woman always saying her fresh batteries just died in her walkie talkie.The way these investigations are drawn out is just  irritating after a few episodes, with useless dialog, useless information not relevant to cases, or useless footage that does not need to be seen. The editors really need to be slapped around too, especially the music cues... if someone is playing a sound file where you are supposed to be able to hear a faint ghostly voice in it, then why would they blare music over the top of it? Every-time you see these guys do the &#34;OMG, WHAT WAS THAT SOUND?&#34; thing, music cues are drowning out the actual sounds.... probably because there is nothing actually there.Some cases they investigated where really interesting, and they where able to duplicate footage or photos and debunk them as being anything more than a hoax... but it seems when they come to ghosts and aliens, they seem to beleive anything. In one particular episode they show how lights in the sky can be faked by holding laser lights against a pain of glass you are filming through... then claim it is not what was in the video, because the lights where too steady rather than them holding it... why didn't they try multiple lasers on a tripod then and move the angle positions around? What really ticked me off was at the end of that episode they claim they caught their own moving lights in the sky on camera... most likely using the same method they had shown before by using a glass sheet and laser pen.

If its not faked, it is something they cannot recreate to verify accurately, but they dont conclude one way or the other at that point.What I find most humorous about this team of \"experts\" and \"scientists\" is that they supposedly exhaust the possibilities before they finally create something that seems a fitting recreation of the actual video in order to declare it \"Faked\".The last episode I watched was a flying witch of some sort from inside a cave looking out.

PARADOX aired across the pond in 2009 on the BBC. Set and shot in Manchester, England, this DVD package is appropriately of a Region 2 persuasion. Too bad the show's deaders. When you've got British sci-fi television fare as freewheeling and in your face as DOCTOR WHO, TORCHWOOD, and PRIMEVAL, it's difficult to compete when your schtick is plodding police procedural and slow burn gratification. LIFE ON MARS, a fellow sci-fi police drama, was able to get away with a minimalist sci-fi premise. But PARADOX was too stingy for too long with reveals concerning those overarching conundrums. The plug was pulled before it found its audience. Like me. I stumbled across it in tardy fashion. Maybe there isn't a Subway franchise in Britain with which its fans can launch a last ditch save-the-show campaign.There are elements here of 24 and FlashForward and even MINORITY REPORT. It offers plenty of mind-warping philosophical and moral quandaries for us to wrap our heads around. Only, I wish there were more of them water cooler moments. Me springing from common denominator viewership, I don't get upset when you ding my brain pan with questions of morality and proper ethics and quantum mechanics, but you best give me the fancy explosions as well. I am shallow and, sad to say, folks like me are legion. In my eyes, PARADOX needed a bit more flash and a more accelerated pace.Five hour-long episodes, totaling 294 minutes, comprise the entire series, and the first episode does offer fireworks. At 2:33am, a series of fragmented images, revealing a massive explosion, are transmitted from the depths of outer space, manifesting on the display screen of space physicist Christian King (Emun Elliott). But the time stamp on the images suggests that the catastrophic event has yet to happen, eighteen hours away. Now a team of police investigators, eyebrows skeptically arched and led by DI Rebecca Flint (a commanding Tamzin Outhwaite), must race against time to avert a potential disaster. As they analyze the mysterious images for long shot leads, it gradually dawns on them that maybe, just maybe, this isn't a prank, that perhaps these images are really from the future. Some react to this epiphany with wide-eyed wonder and excitement. Some are absolutely horrified.Besides the space scientist's dubious assistance - Dr. King is a distant and disdainful git - DI Flint is supported by straight arrow DC Callum Gada (Chike Okonkwo) and loose cannon DS Ben Holt (Mark Bonnar), Flint's off-again, on-again flame. There's a chance that PARADOX over-indulges on the juicy soap opera elements. It's interesting, though, that further episodes go on to challenge the viewer's initial perception of these characters. As the investigating team learns, there's nothing like being exposed to the truth of predestination to rock your foundations and shift your beliefs some. I love that the climax to the first episode doesn't give us the ending we expect. This adds a fascinating dimension of uncertainty to the show. And as a tease to the second episode, we glimpse a new batch of disturbing images streaming on the space scientist's screen.I happen to love this particular sci-fi gimmick. This isn't time travel, but it's the next best thing: a dark message from the future. These five episodes raise those familiar questions: Is the future set in stone? By attempting to change the future, do you, in effect, bring about the very event you were trying to change? These questions have been explored before in other similar shows; there's nothing really new here, from that aspect. Part of the fun is in piecing these fragmented images together so that they finally coalesce into a cohesive narrative. Intriguingly, the team won't have a 100% success rate. I did enjoy the characters' frequently adversarial interactions and the arcs they individually undergo, and how very quickly they venture beyond their lawful jurisdiction. What dropped the ball for me was the plodding pace and the unimaginative police procedural bits. And because the ratings were utterly dismal, PARADOX, lacking enough of those fancy bells and whistles, got the axe before we learn the secrets behind it all. Where do these images originate from? What does it mean when a future suggested by these images is thwarted? How does episode five's bloody cliffhanger ending resolve? You'll just have to shrug it off and move on. If you're one of them types what gets fixated on stuff like that, then I don't recommend trying out PARADOX. Me, I'm still trying to get over the brutal, frustrating demise of POPULAR and EARTH-2 and SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND and TRU CALLING and SURVIVORS and... Hell, it's a long list.The 2-disc DVD set's bonus stuff:- \"Prometheus Bound\" - exploring the set of the Prometheus lab (00:07:10 minutes)- \"The Big Bang\" - Episode One behind-the-scenes shooting of the explosive scene in which a petrol tanker crashes into a bridge (00:06:29 minutes)", "term": "\"God's talking to Manchester.\"", "id": "6346:1_0"}, "6347:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "The series appears to end before much of anything is explained.

What changed?  My personal perspective on the show, and how the producers tried to respond to legitimate criticism to Season 1.  Please allow me to explain:*Ssn 1 was criticized because it had far too many resources, gadgets and supplies available to them.  Quite simply, Ssn 1 was unrealistic in that regard.  Ssn 2, however, went too far the other way:  the Colonists had almost nothing to work with, planted as they were in a Katrina-destroyed and very clearly picked-over area.  .* Second, Ssn 1 had TOO LARGE A CAST, most of whom thus had far too little to do...that was filled with TOO MANY Type A personalities, which created massive ego-driven personality clashes--that were no doubt also stoked by the show's producers, in pursuit of ratings.  Season 2 solved this by casting ZERO Type A personalities--as one Ssn 2 cast member said in about Episode 3, &#34;We're all Indians and no Chiefs.&#34;  It was indeed painful to see Ssn 2 go many weeks with no natural leader emerge...indeed, several of the colonists appeared hostile to even the idea of a leader, and simply wanted to &#34;self-govern.&#34;  Not surprisingly, a lot of &#34;self-governing&#34; looked a lot like &#34;laziness.&#34;  With no one to organize focused efforts, the show languished, kind of wandering through a leaderless vacuum.  Ultimately, the show had to force an election for a leader and, not surprisingly, the colonists' productivity ramped up significantly once this was done..  I now realize this was a problem driven entirely by casting/production decisions.  Understanding this flaw, I watched Ssn 2 in a different light, and got much more out of it, as a result.* Similarly, Ssn 2 cast was smaller, and these colonists per capita had far fewer useful skills for a post-apocalyptic world.  In that regard, Ssn 2 was probably far more realistic than Ssn 1, which had a statistically-impossible group of skilled individuals.  Again, however, the producers over-corrected; thus a &#34;model&#34; with no discernible skills other than her looks and (occasional) berry-picking emerged as one of the power players in the group.  Very unrealistic, and at times reminiscent of a Survivor episode, as the model kept wanting to &#34;vote people off the island!&#34;  Oh, not officially, of course...but effectively.* Finally, Ssn 2 also over-corrected in the area of security threats to the colonists.  Yes, Ssn 1 was impossibly safe.  OTOH, Ssn 2 had many more security threats...and yet absolutely NO ONE with any reasonable skills to address those security threats.  For example, they desperately needed someone with law enforcement or prior military experience, but simply had no one to fill the bill.  Thus, they drifted through the various security threats, repeatedly getting robbed blind...because they had no one with a clue to deal with security.Once I realized all of these over-corrections on the part of The Colony's producers, I was able to watch Ssn 2 with a more reasonable perspective:  the Ssn 2 colonists were set up to fail, whereas the Ssn 1 colonists were set up to succeed AND to drive interpersonal conflicts that rarely seemed reasonable to viewers (they all seemed manufactured by the show).Finally, then...I was able to watch Ssn 2 with fewer expectations...and in that light, I was able to recognize a not-atypical group struggling to survive/cope in a threatening environment...but lacking the natural skills to do so.  Given that understanding, Ssn 2 becomes far more watchable, and there are even many lessons learned from this group's dynamics and experiences.So, I now can recommend The Colony Season 2...as long as I can explain to folks the differences compared to the first season, and also the differences in the cast.  They are two entirely different shows, and should be watched with two entirely different sets of expectations.Give those provisos...Colony Season 2 is worth watching.

The Roman Empire is attempting to complete the conquest of Britain, but is facing fierce resistance from the northern tribes, the Picts. During a Pictish raid on a Roman border garrison, Centurion Quintus Dias is taken prisoner. Determined to end the Pictish threat, Roman governor Agricola dispatches the Ninth Legion under the charismatic General Titus Flavius Virilus to resolve the situation. The Ninth Legion, aided by a treacherous Pictish scout and the escaped Dias, is ambushed and Dias and a small number of survivors must escape back to the Roman lines.Centurion is the fourth movie from British director Neil Marshall, following on from the well-received Dog Soldiers and The Descent (and the not-so-well-received Doomsday), and can be seen as part of a mini-trend of low-budget Roman and medieval films (also including Black Death, Ironclad and The Eagle) made in the last few years.The film has an impressive cast, with the current-hot-property Michael Fassbender starring as Quintus Dias. Fassbender carries the film with aplomb, and makes for a worthy leading man. Dias's restrained, thoughtful but effective style of leadership is contrasted against Dominic West's formidably heroic Virilus, which West handles excellently. After seeing West playing a succession of highly flawed characters, it's a refreshing change to see him playing a stalwart soldier who always does the best thing for his troops. The other actors are also pretty good, most notably Liam Cunningham as the unfortunately-named Ubriculius and David Morrissey as Bothos. Cunnginham, Morrissey and Fassbender have a great on-screen rapport and the scenes where Bothos, 'Brick' and Dias take on the world are great fun.Noel Clarke (Kidulthood and a recurring character on Doctor Who) and Riz Ahmed (whose performance in Four Lions is fantastic) also bring some quality to the smaller roles of Macros and Tarak. Unfortunately, most of the remaining Roman characters lack characterisation to really stand out from the others. The movie also has a rather passive enemy in Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen) who fails to convince as a master warlord and tactician. More impressive is Olga Kurylenko as Etain, the mute warrior who leads the hunt for Dias and his men. Etain is mute, so Kurylenko has to get across her character without the aid of dialogue, which is a formidable challenge but one she rises to. The only other female character of note is Arianne (an interesting but ultimately too-brief appearance by Imogen Poots), a 'witch' the Romans encounter in the woods who turns out to be nothing of the sort.The film starts out as a war movie, with its biggest setpiece being a chaotic battle in the woods clearly inspired by Gladiator's opening battle but with only a small amount of the budget available to film it. Marshall spends his resources wisely here to get maximum bang for his buck, resulting in a reasonably good battle sequence that gets across the incoherent chaos of this type of warfare very well. The rest of the move is a thriller in which one group of characters chases another across the Scottish Highlands. These sequences, filmed on location in Scotland, are stunning, showcasing some of the impressive vistas and landscapes in the north of Britain and adding authenticity to the action.Structurally, the film struggles with the fact that it's basically a countdown to a final confrontation between the hunters and the hunted, and Marshall elects to get this out of the way sooner rather than later, contributing to the film's lean run-time of just 93 minutes. Impressively, he adds a subplot about how the Roman soldiers' years of struggle and sacrifice to bring the Picts to heel is sold short by the Emperor Hadrian's decision to withdraw from the lands they have managed to secure so he can build a new defensive wall. This then factors into the film's ending, giving us a different finale to what viewers may have been expecting given the film's genre and set-up.On the negative side, the movie could have done with engaging with the morality of the situation a bit more decisively. The Romans are invaders in a country not their own and have conducted crimes of unspeakable brutality against the natives. As a result Etain and her people's military campaign against the Romans can be seen as fully justified. However, the film's structure and point-of-view seem to rely on us siding with the Romans. If Marshall was going for a more complex viewpoint - of sympathising with the Roman soldiers on the sharp end of the campaign whilst disapproving of the overall reasons for the invasion and occupation - this is not really given enough screentime to be effective. A sequence nodding in this direction in which Rachael Stirling plays the cunning and ruthless daughter of a Roman senator falls flat, as she only appears in one scene with no preamble. As a result, the movie's moral throughline feels confused and incoherent.Centurion (***) sports some excellent performances, some good pacing and some strong scenes of both characterisation and action. It certainly looks like much more money was spent on it than was the case (it certainly looks more epic and impressive than Ironclad, which had twice the budget of Centurion). Unfortunately, the film misses an opportunity to talk about the rights and wrongs of the situation and the potential for a more nuanced movie about war and occupation is lost. What we are left with is certainly an entertaining, well-made action movie but not much more than that.

It adds blood arcing for some distance into the sky when a lance meets an eyeball. And there are two feral lady barbarians, one blond with what looks like bad teeth (Aeron, played by Axelle Carolyn) and one brunette, whose teeth look just fine, as do her breasts (Etain, played silently by Olga Kurylenko). The brunette fancies skins when she goes out hunting Romans in the deep winter forest and scanty skins when in a hut.Centurion, in other words, is as silly as they come. Briefly, it's about an attempt by the Ninth Legion, led by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West), to march north into what is now Scotland and eliminate the Pict threat. Evidently Virilus never read up on the fate of Publius Quinctilius Varus, no general but a good administrator. Marching deep into the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Germany, he and his three legions were attacked by combined Germanic tribes. Varus committed suicide in the middle of the battle. His three legions disintegrated. Probably 20,000 or more Roman soldiers died compared to a handful of barbarians.General Virilus, virile and confidant, who didn't read his history, marches his men into the thick forests of Pictland.  Flash forward to the next day. Virilus is in chains in the squalid camp of the Pict king. Most of his men have been slaughtered. Later, a handful of survivors led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) try to rescue him. No luck. The Pict king's young son is killed and the general dies in a forced fight with Etain. The seven Romans escape and head south with a handful of Pict hunters (led by Etain and Aeron) hot on their trail. Pict hunters die one by one; the Roman seven almost die one by one.What's good about Centurion? The make-up and the set-designer. Picts look as dirty and flea-bitten as their filthy encampments. Most of the Romans look as filthy as the Picts. There are stunning, craggy, shivering cold scenes of the Highlands.What lacks in Centurion? Characters we can give even a small hoot for. Most of the time we can't remember one from another. Fassbender seems to be a rising star, but all he's called upon to do in this movie is fight, run monotonously and look tired. Only one actor in the cast stands out as tough and smart, and that is that fine actor Liam Cunningham. He's made a lot of drek, but look for him inShooting the Past,Dog SoldiersandThe Wind That Shakes the Barley. The movie's battle scenes, particularly Virilus' march north, is shot only to show slashing swords and more spurts of blood. There's no way to follow the battles. A plot also is lacking. The first third is an excuse for gore. The last two-thirds is an excuse for gore and long-distance running. The roles of Etain and Aeron are a sop to the 18-29-year-old audience the director seems to care most for.Centurion is not a movie.

He should have been more concerned about realism. First, no legion general would go down a narrow road in the mist (or otherwise) without thoroughly scouting it out beforehand. Rome didn't become the military power it did by being ambushed so easily. In the days of Agustus, three legions were ambushed along a narrow, wooded trail in Britain, but there was no way to scout it out beforehand. In fact, the general leading these legions reached a clearing and was on his way back, knowing he had made a grave tactical error and that he couldn't reverse it. The Romans were a fearsome fighting force and small numbers of them routinely decimated much larger armies. The Brits loved to rush in and scare opposing armies by fearful shrieks, which didn't work against highly disciplined soldiers who had fought in many different campaigns from Parthia to Africa and even Germany. Look what happened to Boudica, with an army of 100,000 men when they threw themselves against just one trained legion which waited in a narrow detente uphill and situated between two treelines. Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was actually criticized for taking too many lives -- but it saved Nero from having to retreat from Britain altogether. It's true that Rome caused most of its own problems by its brutality, and they did suffer losses, but not by waltzing down narrow roads in thick fog with no trained scouts to precede them. And BTW, if &#34;the witch&#34; knew about Etan's identity, reputation and the reason for not being able to speak, chaces are the Romans would have known.Finally, the Romans didn't have to kill the Centurion if they wanted to keep the 9th Legion's fate secret. If so, they would have had to kill all the soldiers in the room, as well as the slaves. And if they did want him dead, all they would have had to do was order him to report to the govenor and arrest him. Or, they could have always poisoned his wine.

That is, if you like this sort of meaningless tripe action film. Set in 117 A.D., and as always centering on the mysteriously vanished 9th Legion, Michael Fassbender actually gives an unusually riveting performance as Centurion Quintus Dias. That's right, they gave him a Spanish name that probably wasn't even in existence yet, but Romans will be Romans in whatever century they occupy.Of course, as I translate the only-half-authentic Roman name, it is symbolic: I narrowed its translation to either a literal \"Five Days\" or the much more humorous, symbolic \"Days [are] Numbered\". An even funnier way to read it is \"How Many Days\" and I assume that should end with a question mark. Yep. \"Quintus Dias\" does it to me every time.Here, north of Hadrian's then-new wall, Dias and only a few others survive horrific, gore-laced battles with the Picts (who amazingly speak modern Irish Gaelic, right down to the Anglicized mispronunciations, instead of speaking Pictish, which language is a mystery to us anyway).I began laughing as they were haunted and hunted by a vicious, supernatural Pictish woman called Etaine (wrongly credited as \"Etain\", a Goth makeup nightmare by the name of Olga Kurylenko). Those ladies were tough fighters but they weren't like this. This lady mows down Romans as if they were Legos.There isn't much for me to add to this. There are just too many other films running along these lines, such as the equally ghastlyKing Arthur(2004, see my review),300(2006), the excellent family filmThe Last Legion(2007, see my review) and the equally excellent and underratedThe Eagle(2011, see my review). Of these, THE EAGLE and THE LAST LEGION are by far the finest.I was very impressed by the beautiful Imogen Poots who plays Arianne, the outcaste Pictish witch. Actually she is a healer who got the bad end of the stick - much like Dias will discover he's getting from the Empire after he gets back home. Though here agin a major stumble, since she is altogether far too reminiscent of Sam Neill inMerlin (Special Edition)(see my review).One thing I can say I am heartily sick of seeing is the set of common refrains running through these films (I back down from 300 because I have no time for a film like that): you can always count on stupid anachronisms galore, phony Celtic peoples (\"Hey, why not make 'em all Irish?\"), a Roman on a stupid quest, other colorful foreigners fighting with the Roman on his stupid quest, badly spoken Gaelic or Gobbledygook, Ice Age weather, very bad history overall, vast oceans of blood, violent battles that go on too long and finally, Romans deciding Britain is the pure land and defecting from the Empire.Oh, and let us not forget Hadrian's Wall, which is a bit like the obligatory pratfall in every comedy. It is poetic, a little bit of it is occasionally true - for the most part it is a repetitive bore to see that stuff repeated ad nauseam. Hey! Maybe they should have named Fassbender's Roman soldier Ad Nauseam. Better than Your Days Are Numbered.My recommendation is you watch the other films I mentioned before you see this one. You may find once you've seen a bit of it that you don't want to waste your time watching regurgitations. Then again, you just might develop a bit of a soft spot in your heart for this thing, as I did.It was the really good Roman-era Arthurian film (THE LAST LEGION) and the stunning quasi-gay-Roman-plus-Celt-love story (THE EAGLE) that created that soft spot.

I immediately start to worry when the beginning has to be started twice.How historical this was I do not know and frankly it didn't pique my interest enough to find out.I will say that it was action packed, very bleak and very violent, with a whole lot of running/chasing/running, more running, even more running...fighting, running, more fighting.  I found it amusing that the Romans were a bit put off because the Picts fought \"without honor.\"  Meaning that they didn't fool around but got down to the business at hand: kill or be killed.  They were obviously better at it because they didn't weigh themselves down with heavy noisy armor.  Nor did they march in formation and group themselves into easy targets.  Basically, this was a combat picture and a lesson in enemies (sometimes the person sitting next to you might prove more hazardous to your health than the people you are fighting).

The Roman army, in its quest to conquer Northern England's Picts, gets outsmarted by its enemy and the entire army is reduced to a small handful of men who must now muscle their way back to safety.This is sort of like \"The Warriors\" meets \"Gladiator.\" Our guys need to get to safety and, one by one, their numbers dwindle as they get closer to their goal. This film has a good look. If you recall the opening battle scene in \"Gladiator\" much of that same color palette is used throughout this film.

The biggest problem in the logic with this movie is that it asks you to empathize with the Romans, after establishing that they are the imperialist invaders, crushing the native Picts by any means necessary, and delighting in their torment. At one point, they even murder a child, and you're STILL supposed to empathize with them. One of the primary \"villains\" of this movie is a woman who was brutalized, had her tongue cut out, and watched her family get murdered before her. Yet, she's not the character that the filmmaker chooses to create empathy with- nope, he chooses the Roman who's trying to escape her justice.It's also hard to lose yourself in the movie when there are jarring inconsistencies that were included either as an appeal to juvenile sensibilities, or as the result of some writing that's so lazy it borders on the incomprehensible. As an example of the former problem, every woman who appears in \"Centurion\" looks like a supermodel who just waltzed out of a dressing room where she was pampered by professional hair dressers and makeup artists. I don't know about you, but I find this pretty amusing, when the women in question are barbarian-hunters riding around on horseback, or an exiled witch living out in the middle of the woods. This glaring contrast takes me out of the fiction that has been created on screen, and makes me consider what was going on in the director's head as he issued his orders to the wardrobe department.As an example of the latter problem (lazy writing), there is one scene that is so absurd, it completely takes you out of the movie. It is established that the Pict tracker has such advanced abilities that she can detect the presence of her quarry a quarter mile away, simply because she's downwind from them. That's a bit silly, but I'm okay with that. What makes it absurd is that just a few minutes later, she walks into a small hut where all three of the men she is tracking are hiding. Yet, despite the fact that they are only a few feet away, she cannot detect them. Never mind the fact that they had only a couple of minutes to hide, and they're sweating profusely and bleeding all over the place- nope, our superhuman tracker is completely baffled. What's the explanation? It's simple- the producers painted themselves into a corner and they were too lazy to create a feasible solution.On the positive side, this movie does contain some great geography, striking cinematography, and good choreography (although the gore is over the top, and again directed at juvenile sensibilites).", "term": "Riddled with broken logic, it's hard to ignore the strange paradoxes in Centurion", "id": "6405:1_0"}, "6406:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The legend of the &#34;missing&#34; ninth Roman legion has been explored many times, most recently in &#34;The Eagle,&#34; but this film follows the traditional view the legion was ambushed in a heavily wooded area by the Picts, and the Roman government kept it quiet to encourage the myth the legions were invincible.

The concept of a big power (here the Roman Empire AD 117) making a preemptive war on a smaller, 'different' culture (the Picts of Scotland) cannot help but muster comparison to current US preemptive (and unsuccessful) attacks in the Middle East.  Though it is doubtful that the writer director Neil Marshall's cinematic vision included this idea, the historic decimation of the Roman Ninth Legion's failure to conquer the Picts is poignant food for thought.But on to the story.  In 117 AD one of the few areas not controlled by the Roman Empire was the northern portion of the British Isles, land of the Picts, a strange tribal like people with determined, terrifyingly ferocious fighting techniques.  General Titus Flavius Virilus (Domenic West) is given orders from the Roman Emperor to capture that stronghold, and he is off with the Ninth Legion to conquer.  A born leader and beloved by his troops, Virilus fights valiantly but is captured and there is only one man deemed his replacement - former gladiator Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbinder, a major actor remembered for this disparate roles as in `Hunger', `Inglourious Basterds', `300', `Band of Brothers' etc). Centurion is finally left with a handful of men (JJ Field, Lee Ross, David Morrisey, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Dimitri Leonidas, Riz Ahmed) who attempt to complete the mission.  One mute female warrior Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict turned Roman Guide, quickly turns her allegiance to her homeland and becomes the most treacherous fighter of them all.  At one point the son of Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen), the leader of the Picts, is killed by a Roman and the ferocity of the battle is heightened.  The Roman troops endure untold hardships, are given hospitality by a Pict castaway Arianne (Imogen Poots) with whom Centurion becomes enamored, and eventually only Centurion remains as the sole survivor of the Roman Ninth Legion. The effect of his experience and knowledge of the war failure causes the Roman Empire to decide a fate for him and the rest is best left unsaid.There is little dialogue, but what there is is solid. The battle scenes are appropriately gory and the cinematography by Sam McCurdy and the musical score by Ilan Eshkeri sustain the atmosphere.  Michael Fassbinder proves that he is indeed a major talent, and the entire cast is excellent.  It is a great little film for diversion, it could easily have been extended (only 98 minutes) for better fleshing out of the characters, but the final words of the Centurion suggest that there likely will be sequels.

In the horror genre, he did some solid work with the satisfying werewolf tale \"Dog Soldiers\" and the sublimely staged \"The Descent\" (which I know has its detractors, but for me was one of the most entertaining films of its year).  The \"Mad Max\" retread \"Doomsday\" was an inevitable disappointment--but didn't dispel the notion that, at least, Marshall had a visual flair.  I was intrigued to see him wander into \"Gladiator\" type territory with \"Centurion\" because the man can stage one heck of a battle.  While the film, which is certainly better than \"Doomsday,\" has a lot going for it--sadly, it ends up missing the mark.  My guy reaction as I turned to my friend at the end was \"Man, I wanted to like that much more than I did!\"I was genuinely and actively rooting for \"Centurion\" to be more wholly satisfying--so I guess that's a positive comment in and of itself.  First off, the film looks absolutely incredible.  The sweeping countryside and mountainous terrain as the camera pans across is breathtaking.  The battle sequences are alive and bloody--not as dreary as some recent higher profile epics.  The film sounds fantastic with a pulsing orchestration that fits the film beautifully.  But the film's greatest asset is its star Michael Fassbender.  A sensation in the art house favorite \"Hunger,\" Fassbender claims leading man status with ease.  His grounded physicality and intelligence shine through--at times, you think that he's smarter than the material he's been dealt.The film covers the period of A.D. 117 when Roman troops were engaged in a struggle and trying to advance upon the the Picts in the Scottish highlands.  The Picts employed guerilla tactics to hold the Romans off for 20 years.  I won't, but could, debate historical accuracy in the film, but it is clearly meant to be an adventure yarn and not a historical treatise.  However, the film seems to want us to identify with the Romans and brand the Picts as the villains when all they wanted to do was defend their land from being conquered.  Not so bad in my book.  My main issues with the film is that sometimes the screenplay can be conveniently silly.  Several times the Picts don't finish off the stragglers after the epic battle by choice (\"oh, just let him bleed\"). Their guerilla camp is invaded by not one, but about 6, Romans soldiers in a rescue attempt--not very alert for guerillas!  And a tracker who could trail soldiers for hundreds of wilderness miles couldn't find them in a one room cabin!  These are but a few examples that had me scratching my head.I won't even discuss the unnecessary twist ending or the tacked-on romance, I'll just say that \"Centurion\" ended up losing some of my good will.  I'd probably still recommend the film as light entertainment, especially if you put your brain on hold, but I wanted it to be great!

I liked this movie very much and many scenes are simply unforgettable.The action is set in year 117 AD, in the country which today is called Scotland but which Romans named Caledonia. This harsh and inhospitable land was inhabited by tribes which Romans called first Caledonians and later Picts. Caledonia was the only part of main British island which was not controlled by Roman Empire and Caledonians/Picts resisted fiercely all attempts of conquest - and in fact, in Ist and IInd centuries, frequently attacked Roman part of the island. The movie describes an episode of those Pictish wars, although because of lack of precise sources, it is not exactly based on real events and the names of the main leaders (Roman general Virilus and Pictish king Gorlacon) are fictive.To avoid spoilers I will not say much more about the plot - but please be aware that this is a very brutal and bloody movie, full of scenes of realistically described close quarters combat, but also of torture and murder. I believe this realism is ultimately an asset, but many people (and I think most women) will certainly find \"Centurion\" too shocking to watch. Under no circumstances children or younger teenagers should be allowed to see this movie - and I would in fact deeply recommend to restrict it only to those who are aged 18 years or more.\"Centurion\" shows a great deal of incredibly beautiful images of nature in northern part of Scotland (especially Cairngorms mountains and Badenoch district), attempting to show how did it look in times when its population was still scarce and nature mostly remained wild and untouched, with wolves and deers more easily met than humans. The forest scenes were filmed in natural parks in England. Those settings alone are a good reason to see \"Centurion\" as they are simply impossible to describe - you simply must see them! For that reason also I would really recommend to watch it on the biggest possible screen.Actors play well and the characters are interesting and well thought. Michael Fassbinder plays the main hero, centurion Quintus Dias, and his performance is very honest. However, two other actors steal the show from him: Dominic West and especially Olga Kurylenko.Dominic West already showed how versatile actor he was playing the ambiguous character of detective McNulty in \"The Wire\" but also the abject Spartan politician Theron in \"300\". Here he portrays the Roman general Virilus in another excellent performance. It was a pleasure to watch him.But the REAL performance is that of Olga Kurylenko, who plays Etain, a silent, never smiling Briton tracker/scout working for Romans. Etain can not speak (when she was a child her tongue was cut off) but still, her character dominates the whole movie - and it is not only because of the great beauty of Ms Kurylenko, as she is mostly wrapped in furs and her face is partly hidden by blue war paintings. Really, I found this character fascinating and totally unforgettable and I am certain she will mark you too!And finally a special mention for Imogen Poots, a very cute and absolutely lovely British actress who plays Pictish sorceress, Arian, and the gorgeous Belgian actress Axelle Carolyn (who is also the wife of the director of the movie, Neil Marshal), who plays Pictish female warrior, Aeron. This importance accorded to women is another point in favor of this movie. In Pictish society women were mostly equals of men and most of them were also warriors, to the point that some fought in battles carrying babies attached on their backs!Now, the one thing I did not totally like in this movie is the flawed representation of the way in which Roman Legions marched, camped and especially fought. When watching \"Centurion\" you must inevitably ask the question \"But how come those guys could conquer so many countries and build a three continent empire?\" The answer is, those guys did not - but the real legions did, because they made war totally differently than pictured in this film. And this is a pity, because there clearly was an effort to stick to historical reality - like for example the fact that in this movie Roman soliders wear \"lorica segmentata\" armour, which in those times just replaced the previously used \"lorica hamata\" (chain mail). But the effort was not made when the tactics are described.I will just focus on the biggest issue - fighting tactics. Roman regular infantry was so dangerous because it used a mixture of missile and close combat weapons. The enemy was first engaged with highly specialized heavy javelins, the \"pilum\", of which every infantryman carried two: one lighter and one heavier. The lighter javelin was thrown first (because it had a longer range), then the heavier and then only the legion would close the ranks in a shield wall and engage the enemy with short but quite heavy Roman swords \"gladius\". The important thing is that Roman swords were perfectly adapted for stabbing (with an upward thrust) but rather poorly suited for slashing. Or in \"Centurion\" NOT EVEN ONE \"pilum\" is thrown and in fact Roman soldiers do not even carry them. Instead all of them have classical long spears - which in reality would be used only by a small minority of eldest soldiers (whose arms were not so strong and their eyes not so good anymore) for protection against a possible cavalry charge. Also Roman soldiers slash wildly at their enemies with their short swords, without even trying to use them efficiently...There is also the little point of a general who walks through hostile wild country without any flank guard, even if he has some nimble footed auxiliary light infantry suited for this task - one of the heroes, Leonidas, is after all a lightly equipped Greek slinger. And of course any such expedition should relay for all reconnaissance only on one indigenous tracker and two Roman cavalrymen, giving a total of three (yes, three!) horse riding scouts for the security of a whole army (the Ninth Legion and all its \"auxillia\").However, although I certainly did not like that part of the movie, all the rest was so good and made on me such a strong impression, that I simply couldn't take one star off the rating.", "term": "Good peplum action/survival \"western\", grandiose settings and an incredible role of Olga Kurylenko!", "id": "6414:1_0"}, "6415:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "How could a bunch of heavily trained Gladiators fall prey to a band of nomads.If I were fighting for my survival, I would have moved when heavy fiery boulders were coming towards me.Hello, move back when they're gone.A whole legion was wiped out in minutes.Believable ...Uh ...

Kurylenko is interesting in the role...  Even covered up in bulky skins, face painted over and wearing an almost permanent snarl on her face, she still looks a little too gorgeous for the role.  However, her physicality won me over, as she almost convinces that a young woman could go mano a mano (so to speak) with highly trained veteran legionaries.One thing the movie really has going for it is the look.  Period movies can so often show the shortcomings of a limited budget - but here the production values are excellent.  We believe we are looking at the 9th, and the Roman armour and trappings look the biz.  The scenery is sumptuous.  Afterall, this is Scotland - albeit some of the bleaker parts, with either snow or drizzle in many scenes.. not necessarily the tourist board approved stuff.So it's no masterpiece, but fairly and squarely tackles Hollywood at its own game, and comes away without egg on its face.  The more you think about it, the more questions you might have, and if you're a historian - well, this is as close to the reality of what happened to the 9th as Gladiator was to how Emperor Commodus died.

Things end up not going so well, as soon enough Quintus and a handful of others are hunted down by the fierce, animalistic warriors.  While Centurion offers up ample amounts of bloody violence, warrior philosophy, and gorgeous cinematography; the film as a whole doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before in any other media of this type, whether it be 300 (which Fassbender and West both oddly enough starred in), HBO's Rome, or even the Spartacus series on Starz, minus the slow-motion/quick-edit fight scenes that is, which we should all be thankful for here.

The primary protagonist is a fully honorable soldier, but some of his companions are arguably less so. However, since their survival is tied to one another, they have to get along. The really cool aspect of the story in my opinion is the depiction of them basically jogging/running everywhere. Want to get somewhere in the olden days and you dont have a horse, you gotta run.

OK, I am a Roman history pedant and aficionado of historical novels, so I brought to this a critical eye, but also a hope that I would get enveloped in the narrative, in subtle character, in wonder at the endless varieties of human ambition.  At this, it was so successful that I forgot the present with complete delight, even after 2 full viewings.In terms of history, this is fiction based on speculation about what happened to the 9th Legion, which disappeared from the historical record without a trace - the only way to limn what happened to them is to piece together ambiguous clues, such as the inscriptions on grave stones scattered throughout the former empire.  The time is that of the Emperor Hadrian, the golden age of the Roman Empire - the series of good, circumspect emperors who governed judiciously and without the insane excess that is remembered with Nero or Commodus.  Rome is one of the largest stable empires the world has ever known, though it has experienced resistance in certain areas, such as the Picts in Northern Britain or the Parthians in Central Asia.  Whatever happened, the film that concocts an explanation, and it is as plausible as an other, with plenty of fictional speculation and fantasy thrown in to build a narrative.To be honest, the film either works for you or it doesn't.  All I can say is, if you liked HBO's Rome, this is the same kind of grainy, highly textured portrait, just not in the center (Rome) but on the periphery.  I believe this preference is personal and subjective, a pure matter of taste.  It is extremely bloody, with realistic battle sequences that are not for the squeamish.The plot follows a non-commissioned officer (Centurion), acted by the wonderful Michael Fassbender.  Long a fighter of Picts (he knows their language), he survives an attack on an outpost and is rescued by the 9th, who are about to make war on the Picts.  They are led by the incredible Dominic West (of The Wire), a charismatic general who has led his men to glory in Spain and is now establishing them in Britain; he is a gifted brute, but extremely popular with the men, from whom he rose by talent.  Their scout is Olga Kurilenko (yes, a Bond girl), a mute and mysterious young Pict.After the quick decimation of the 9th, Fassbender and a handful of survivors seek to rescue the general by duty, deep in Pict Scotland.  Upon failure and an unfortunate murder, they must flee for their lives while an elite corps of Pict warriors pursue them with a blood oath of vengeance.  At their head is a killer of singular talent, whose family was brutalized and executed before her eyes, then she was raped and left for dead.  As described, \"she is an empty vessel that can only be filled with Roman blood.\"  When you see her, you believe it.  I will not reveal what happens, only to say that it is acted to utter perfection.There has been much criticism of the Romans as \"good guys\" in this film.  I think it is far more subtle than that:  no one is good, no one bad, they are all just striving to live the way they want, in accordance with their traditions.  The Picts are genuinely savage warriors, but the reasons for their ruthless ferocity are completely clear:  the Romans brutilized them in unspeakable ways as demonstrated more than once.  For their part, the Romans are simple soldiers, part of a military machine the likes of which the world had never known.  They are not good guys, they just are what they are:  disciplined killers who will follow their leaders to the death for duty and hopefully glory.  They are tougher beyond imagination, with their own codes of honor, though clearly one of the survivors is a sociopath.  Another much criticized plot incident is the girl and love story.  I suppose you could say it is unrealistic, but what the heck, it is a movie.  To me, it was believable and moving (in however a superficial way you might want).  Roman political machinations are also surprising, believable, and subtle.This is not the kind of thing a pedant like me should pick apart.  It is just a darn good story that completely absorbed me for 2 viewings.  I will certainly watch it again.

It was difficult to read on my analog TV, especially when they opt for white on a pale blue background using an ancient looking font that is difficult to decipher in the first place. Now the reason why we have subtitles is for the Picts, who are native of Northern Britain. They don't speak English, but the Romans speak 21st century English, including one soldier with a British accent. \"Sorry mate, but orders are orders,\" he says as he slices a Pict throat. OH PLEASE! If the Picts don't speak modern English, don't try to make it realistic with subtitles only to have the Romans speak English. The language spoken by the Picts is actually unknown.A Roman governor wanting to make a name for himself, opts to send the 9th Roman legion into the Pict stronghold in order to kill their king. The Roman governor uses a female Pict slave (whose parents were murdered by Romans, with her being raped as a child and her tongue cut out) to guild them into Pict territory. Guess how that works out Scooby-Doo? The ninth legion is wiped out except for the general who is taken captive and 7 Romans (who look more like an international group).

These critics should have stuck with the countless bathroom humor comedies and inane human dramas populating the theaters as of late and leave the action movie genre to the people who appreciate them.

But you should know what you're NOT getting, in order to avoid disappointment.I had seen only the trailer and good reviews on Amazon. I was expecting more of an action-y British gangster film. But it's not really an action film -- although MUCH happens -- and that's a *good* thing. It is devilishly suspenseful.The first ten minutes are masterful. They quickly becoming horrifyingly suspenseful -- totally without dialogue. (The first line of dialogue is said at approx 6 min in.) That sounds boring, but it is the exact opposite: riveting. The story begins, and you must pay attention. The more attention you pay, the more compelling it becomes. This is *not* a movie to have on in the background while you clear off the kitchen table or do dishes. (My boyfriend does this all the time. It drives me nuts because he'll say, \"Eh, I didn't think [insert movie title] was that good\" and I'll say, \"Well, you really didn't watch it, you mostly had your back to it!\" And then when I make him sit down and watch movies I've liked, he'll say, \"I totally didn't get that the first time I saw it\" and I'm like, \"Yeah, 'cause you didn't *see* it!!\" Argh.)This is a movie to make popcorn for and sit down to really *watch* -- don't answer your phone, don't play with your tablet, make sure any kids are in bed and can't disturb you.The actions of the two men in preparation to commit a serious crime heighten the suspense. The supplies they gather are curious, then intriguing, then horrifying in their implications. The spaces in which they work are large with wide camera angles. Over time, throughout the film, both the spaces and camera angles slowly shrink, adding a visual claustrophobia to the psychological tension as the film progresses.The soundtrack is like a fourth character (and I'd like to buy it). It never gives things away, but alternates setting the mood with punctuating the plot twists and shifting dynamics. Pure music -- synthesizer-based modern sounds alternating with haunting organic notes of solo viola or cello -- evokes moods and heightens the emotion of unexpected twists, moments of pathos, shifts of alliance. It doesn't use pop music to buttress lousy chemistry or muddy action.This movie is not what the trailer implies. Truly unexpected plot twists alternate with slow reveals of the relationship dynamics, character back-stories (without flashbacks), and shifting alliances. Every time I thought I knew what would happen, who the characters were, what they were about to do -- I was wrong. As a jaded and cynical movie fan, and tired of predictable, cliche-ish, dumbed down movies, I found this movie fiendishly fun to try to figure out -- and I never really succeeded.Gemma Arterton's Alice is integral to the plot. She does a great job, she definitely holds her own -- but she by no means carries the film by herself, as the Amazon summary says. It's truly an ensemble, albeit a small one of only three people. The two male leads were gripping to watch. Eddie Marsan is amazing as Vic. (He was Inspector Lestrade from Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes reboots; he was also in two of the Channel 4 Red Ridings, and in the BBC's Little Dorrit). Vic's evolution is unexpected, believable, brilliantly done, and (by the end) surprisingly sympathetic. Martin Compston was new to me (I never watched Monarch of the Glen). But he's fantastic as the (initially) inexplicably conflicted Danny, seemingly one-down in the criminal partnership. In fact, the acting by both male leads is so good, your sympathy shifts back and forth from the obviously sympathetic victim character Alice to the two males, who initially are totally unsympathetic (because you think you know who they are and what they're about to do).The Disappearance of Alice Creed is not a \"big\" film with crashing violence and lots of guns and explosions. It's one of those films where the implied violence is almost as devastating as the violence that *is* committed. Like David Cronenberg's films, when violence or action occurs in this film, it *means* something: it has consequences -- it's not just there for vicarious and bloodless audience thrills. And although this movie fraks with you, it's not a conventional mind-frak movie, either. It's definitely a psychological thriller.Don't view this movie expecting Sexy Beast or In Bruges or a Guy Ritchie movie -- or even Layer Cake, with which it has some kinship psychologically and perhaps morally (but it never tries to be as consciously cool as Layer Cake). The Disappearance of Alice Creed has more in common thematically with the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple or No Country For Old Men, or with Carl Franklin's thriller One False Move. It's deadly serious about itself and that pays off in how unique and authentic the plot and characters feel. It's up to you whether you find the ending uplifting or bleak, a morality tale or an inevitability.WARNING: Stick through the first half hour/forty minutes, even if it looks/feels like it's about to become cheap Hollywood torture porn. It isn't. It's a much better and smarter film than that. By smart, I do not mean clever like a Guy Ritchie film is clever. (Not that there is anything wrong with that: I love Ritchie's films.) I mean, the entire thing could have easily been B-movie material -- but the script, the directing, the acting, and the execution elevate it way above a B-movie.There is a lot of female nudity, but I did not find it gratuitous (there's also a good amount of corresponding male nudity, under different circumstances). It's typically British matter-of-fact nudity. The female nudity serves the plot and heightens the vulnerability of the victim, but, as a woman, I found it to be as tastefully done as possible under the circumstances. If this had been made in Hollywood, the nudity would have been far greater, far more gratuitous, and much more like B-movie torture-porn. Fortunately, it wasn't made in Hollywood -- one of the reasons why it's so good.In a completely unintentional way I'm sure, I almost find The Disappearance of Alice Creed to thumb its nose at your average Hollywood thriller. It shows how good a movie can be when you focus on script, plot, acting, and direction -- to the exclusion of focusing on butts-in-seats and opening weekends, or trying to tweak those with focus groups and test screenings.The DVD extras are decent. Haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but the dual-screen comparison of the storyboards with the actual film was interesting and shows how well they adhered to the original visual conception. The outtakes are funny moments of the actors forgetting their lines or being unable to get past a fit of giggles (the guys, surprisingly). I watched the outtakes mostly to assure myself that nothing really bad happened to any of the actors -- that's how authentic and compelling the plot and characters are! I feel silly admitting that, but the first third of the movie is rather knuckle-whitening to sit through, especially as a woman -- you really fear the worst for Alice.Also: as with many British films, I had to watch it the first time with the subtitles on, or I wouldn't have understand some of the dialogue. I recommend this to non-British viewers unfamiliar with the accents of various parts of the UK. My second and third viewings, I didn't need the subtitles.

No serious torture, rape, blatant gore, or anything like that: Just basic abduction violence and some nudity. Still, the very sounds of that poor woman's screams were almost more than I could stomach, and I think that's saying a lot. As you can probably surmise, this film is not for the faint of heart. Nevertheless, it goes through some very believable twists and turns as it proceeds, and the ending is about as satisfying as it realistically could be. The whole experience is more like being a silent witness to an actual event than someone merely sitting in front of a screen watching a movie.Alice Creed and her two kidnappers (all admirably played) are the only people of any sort we see in this film, and the scope's a little claustrophobic at first. At the beginning, I kept wanting some view of the world outside, but the suspense of the film quickly drew me in to where I forgot all about that, which is probably the effect the directors wanted.THE DISAPPEARANCE of ALICE CREED is a true study in suspense. In the end, however, the theme and tension are more psychological than anything else. It's ultimately about the suspicions that arise between partners in crime, as well as the cat-mouse games played between the victim and her victimizers.Tip: The British brogues can be a little hard to follow without the subtitles.", "term": "An Abduction in Micro-View", "id": "6486:1_0"}, "6487:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "We have seen this before.

But due to the weaknesses of men, the plan starts to unravel like last year's sweater and it spells dire consequences for the bad guys.Some have touted this as a study in psychological manipulation. Though there is some of that present I didn't consider it the core of the film. The abductee is bound and gagged throughout most of it so one doesn't get the same deterioration that has taken place in similar movies such as \"Deceiver.\" Don't get me wrong. She does throw a monkey wrench into the works but there is no great amount of cleverness on her part.This is a good script that is handled well by the three core actors. Eddie Marsan has a face you can pick out of a crowd and he's something to see here. He makes you nervous pretty much every time he's on screen which is a lot. Martin Compston and Gemma Arterton are no slouches either. All three do a great job in keeping the script moving and believable. There are only a couple of indoor and outdoor sets and the three actors. No fancy this, that or the other thing. It's all writing and acting.

It is a film that no doubt will become a cult favorite as it takes so many chances and makes them all work exceptionally well.The film opens silently as two men, ex-cons Vic (Eddie Marsan) and Danny (Martin Compston), go about their business buying materials to soundproof and block out the windows and apply multiple locks in a sleazy apartment as well as prepare a van in the same way.  They don black clothes and hoods and wait in their prepared van for the moment of expectation - the kidnapping of a girl, Alice Creed (Gemma Arterton) as she leaves her home.  The conversation begins as the men take the screaming girl to the hideaway where they tie her to a bed and gag her, explaining that she will be released when her wealthy father pays the two million dollar ransom.  From this point on the story develops along novel lines as Vic and Danny continue their preparations and Alice struggles for control.  There are many surprises that develop in the interplay of the three characters: sharing any of those developments in a review would be unfair to those who have not seen the film.  Suffice it to say that every moment is filled with tension and brilliant acting on the part of all three of the characters in this story that is so well paced that the unexpected ending seems to come far too soon.J Blakeson takes a lot of risks here, courageous healthy risks that pay off handsomely.  The claustrophobia of the hideaway is well sculpted by cinematographer Philipp Blaubach and the scant but evocative musical score by Marc Canham adds to the mood. Controversial and probably not a good film for audiences easily intimidated by visuals, THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED  is one of the finest films of the past year.  Highly recommended on every level.

The acting was very creditable, and I enjoy dramas that play out in small spaces with few characters.  But in this case, none of the characters was likeable enough for me to care what happened to him or her.  There is no way to say anything more about this movie without massive spoilers, so be warned.The suspense of the story depends largely on the rate of revelation attached to our learning the interrelationships among key characters.  Throughout the course of the story, we find out that not only is Alice romantically attached to one of the kidnappers, but that the two (male) kidnappers are romantically attached to each other.  That puts one kidnapper as a pretty interesting corner of a triangle, and makes him pivotal to how the story eventually unfolds.There is a relatively high \"ick\" factor with a not-unrealistic (but not terribly welcome) focus on toilet functions, vomit, and awkward sex (and no, I don't mean the men kissing, although I'm sure some would include that on an \"ick factor list\" as well).  All the action that takes place within the kidnapper's hideout seem completely realistic and natural, but once the locations start changing, it becomes hard to believe that events play out as they do.  People do not seem to die, for example, until their full dramatic potential has been reached, which might make for all right entertainment, but in a story set apart by its attention to verisimilitude, it does strain credulity to the snapping point.I feel compelled to mention one aspect of the movie that was well, well above the standards for most thrillers of this type (even the artier thrillers), and that's the music, which was perfectly complementary, unobtrusive, but powerfully effective in evoking the appropriate feelings of excitement, stress, dread, and relief.If you like Hitchcock-style suspense and stories that turn very much of characters and relationships, there is much to like in \"Alice Creed.\"  For my part, I did not find the ultimate destination much worth the travel...but then, I never found Alice a very sympathetic character.", "term": "Easy to see what people who liked this film liked about it.", "id": "6489:1_0"}, "6490:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I took a chance in buying this via video on demand and enjoyed it.

I took a complete chance on it and was absolutely riveted. I'd hoped for a good suspense thriller with some unexpected twists and turns and this one delivered those things - and more. Once you've seen the film, however, you won't be surprised the next time around so why buy it? Rent it instead - perhaps through Video on Demand. Why pay more for it?The pace of the film is strong throughout while the style varies, especially at the start, and builds to the ultimate suspenseful moments. You'll get to know each character over time.In the beginning, two men are clearly preparing for the kidnapping of Alice Creed (Gemma Arterton). This is accomplished with quick film shots and no dialogue, leaving viewers with the impression that this might be a straightforward hostage event but that doesn't turn out to be the case. Also in the opening scenes? A room is soundproofed and windows are boarded while a van is prepared along with a mouth gag, handcuffs and a bag to cover the victim's face. Everything seems in order and all goes smoothly - at first.The men move efficiently and in a no nonsense manner. There is also some tension between them and some small arguments (again, mostly towards the beginning). They appear to be working together but without emotion and with some differences in their personalities. They seem simply out to obtain a massive ransom. But as the movie unfolds, the kidnappers and victim display a wider range of emotions. Cracks in the plan start to appear but the events still aren't boring or completely predictable.Much of the film depends on understanding the nonverbal cues of the actors so do watch carefully for those moments when trust and mistrust are displayed. Having noted that, I don't want to give specific spoilers so will only note that there are enough surprises to keep viewers watching to see what happens next. I could predict one of these moments but there were others which I didn't see coming. The ending seemed a bit predictable (but not totally) and the film was still extremely satisfying.While I give this one 5 stars for being so much better than the average thriller these days, I could find some flaws in the film, particularly towards the end, but they were minor compared to the performances of the actors, people which I didn't recognize (except for Gemma Atherton).The least believable section of the film happened after an event in some woods.

I, for one, had no fore knowledge of \"The Disappearance of Alice Creed\" and, consequently, rather limited expectations. So when I sat down with friends and plugged \"Disappearance\" into the DVD player, I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. And for once, my pessimism about the movie's prospects were completely unfounded. After an almost wordless set-up, I was already drawn into this tight little chamber piece. Several major twists later and I was delighted to have uncovered a little known gem! With just three characters and a confined and claustrophobic set, \"Disappearance\" is theatrical (play-like, if you will) in its intimacy. But writer/director J. Blakeson uses this inherent staginess well to create a seamless thriller of lies, deceit, and plans gone wrong.I will say very little about what transpires in \"The Disappearance of Alice Creed.\" Knowing the film's twists in advance may not ruin the movie's effectiveness--but, trust me, it's best just to let this one unfold. All you get from me is this--two armed and masked men take a young, wealthy woman hostage. Keeping her strapped down and helpless, they await a ransom. But all does not go according to plan, needless to say--but you probably guessed that. That's it--I'll go no further.Gemma Arterton plays the unwitting victim in this equation while Eddie Marsan and Martin Compston portray the kidnappers. Marsan is intense and Arterton is appealing, but Compston essays the most difficult role as a sort of a go-between. He is terrific, and all three actors pull their weight in this deadly triangle. But perhaps the biggest star of \"The Disappearance of Alice Creed\" is Blakeson's screenplay. Using standard thriller conventions, but tweaking them with unexpected revelations, this thriller might have lost all credibility. But Blakeson never pushes too far, maintains the suspense, and the casts brings home the show with much gusto. I really had a good time with this film and it is a definite recommendation.

Then they ask for their money, some things happen, and everything seems to go a little awry.When reviewing this, I do have to mention that the movie does have some twists that I did not expect to see. There were some things that were hidden in the dynamic between the kidnappers, some things in the kidnapper/kidnappee, and just some things in general. There were also some exciting places in it that would get me to watch it again, and that make me happy to have checked it out. i simply do not know if I would go further and pick it up, because kidnappings don't seem to go beyond the act and the actions that take place between abduction and money (in my opinion - others may love them).As far as this type of movie, however, everything was set yup in ways that worked out well. The plot was bendable but not believeable, the things that happen sometimes make you think that everything could blow up any time, and you really don't know exactly what could happen. The situation is strange as is, and it gets stranger as the events transpire. That makes for good movie watching and the acting propelled it further.As I mentioned, this is not my genre BUT I liked it. I would watch it again so, in a lot of ways, I think that says something. for people who like movies like this, there is not any nudity to speak of, no gore and little violence, but some perhaps questionable material - depending on who you are (it didn't even dawn on me to think of it that way until writing this, however, so it isn't something really off or anything).

And it is not COMPLETELY bad; it is more tolerable than a lot of the other stupid children's series out nowadays, so that is why I gave it an extra star. However, the humor is not the best.This is one of those programs featuring characters (particularly Otis more than anyone else) who are quite dim with bouts of cockiness and conceit that are very irritating. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but this series doesn't do a good job of portraying that in a funny way. And he does get his comeuppances frequently after having someone else top him, but often through predictable but ridiculous changes or circumstances or idiotic plot twists. The characters are either dimwitted, cocky, saucy, or all of the above either simultaneously or during certain situations, and in a way that is intended to tickle viewers' funny bones but is so dumb that it fails. Many characters are so moronically-obnoxious that it's infuriating rather than entertaining. A shining example of one of these characters is Snotty Boy, who the writers try so hard to depict as obnoxious and bratty that they overdo it on his personality, and he comes off as so annoying and idiotic that it's really not that funny. That is the thing about this show: when they try to portray particular characters a certain way, they over-dramatize the qualities that make them appear that way (i.e. charitable, sweet, feminine) to such a degree that it's just downright stupid rather than laughable, like how they're intending. (for example, a character with an overly- sweet personality would sound like this: \"I'll go pick flowers and frolic through the meadows riding on a unicorn's back\" in those exact words. No character has used those exact lines, I believe, but often very similar ones. It's supposed to be humorous, but it is so stupid that it is not). There's a good degree to over-dramatize things and a bad one in comedy. If you go to the bad one, then it makes things seem stupid.Sorry that this review is so long. It is just difficult to describe what makes this program so moronic, in my opinion. If you are unfamiliar with the series and have not ever really seen an episode before, go online and watch a few for yourself and you'll see what I mean.

I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched all 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle, is embodied by Rob Brydon, from The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.

His writing is funny, his way of speaking is funny, his movements are funny. There is an awful angularity to him, he bends at all the wrong places, his knees are up too high. To watch him try to open a bottle of wine is to watch an exercise in uncoordination that is funnier than the entire output of every stand up comic since the Greek guy with the rocks in his mouth. And the situations and dialogue he created, because it was Cleese who wrote the scripts for Fawlty Towers, are even better.Basil Fawlty is wonderful to watch. He is craven and bullying at the same time, a pompous suck up, utterly incompetent, a blowhard who blames his shortcomings and failures on the world. Cleese has the character down pat...that supercillious little git of a hotel manager or railway station clerk, the middle manager who is in over his head, with steam coming out of his ears, convinced that the world is out to get him.  In real life, they're horrible. When they are running Fawlty Towers, they are a thing of wonder to behold.Basil's wife is beautifully underplayed by the incomparable Prunella Scales. Sybil Fawlty is a woman inured to Basil's tantrums, shenanegans and schemes. She tells him what to do, then spends the rest of her time on the phone, saying \"I knoooooow\" and \"Reeeeeee-alllllly\" to her friend at the other end of the line. She gets more humor out of those phone responses than most TV sitcom characters can get out of an entire script. Basil cannot, will not, do what this sensible little person says.  When Basil looks at Sybil with his gimlet eye and mumbles \"Coiffed Shrub,\" if you don't fall out of your chair and drop to the floor, convulsed with laughter, you must be Swiss.No offense.Connie Booth, who is American, was married to Cleese and co-wrote the show with him. Booth has a smaller role as the hotel chambermaid...and the voice of reason who plucks Basil from the edge of the abyss only to find he knows another route.Even if you are from the Bunderstadt, you will have to laugh at Manuel, the Barcelonian waiter (played by Andrew Sachs). Manuel's blank and totally mindless stare, his utter lack of comprehension as Basil--hair sticking out above his temples, sweat on his upper lip, eyes blazing with rage and madness, body bent in some impossible configuration that has his torso and hips and knees zigzagging away from one another at impossible angles--tries to get him to perform the simplest task, must surely cripple you with laughter.No offense.If you are among the six people on the Earth who have not seen Fawlty Towers, drop what you are doing and watch.  The show ran so briefly, there are very few episodes, but they never get old and never get stale.  Even so, in a perfect world, George Bush would not have invaded Afghanistan.

(Look for the DVD set that actually has the documentary and APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH bonus. It is NOT available anymore on Amazon, and it is not billed as being \"Season 12\" as such. Also note the films here are NOT 'series 12', which is the penultimate season, the last being 'series' 13.)Oh boy. As if the DVD release fiasco isn't evil enough, devout fans have noted how bad this particular series is, but POIROT has always been tending toward this, ever since it got picked up by PBS/WGBH Boston/\"Masterpiece Mystery!\"--a/k/a \"Mystery!\" because it is a mystery why everything they do is so awful. I have already reviewed Suchet's ORIENT EXPRESS, and while I was a bit unhappy with Suchet's performance, I felt he performed it this way for a reason. He's grieving here, for all the guilty people who get away with murder and those denied justice.This grumpiness and aged look has been dogging Suchet since 2001, that is, since he began playing Poirot again (after his 3-year hiatus which started in 1996, after he completedPoirot - Dumb Witness). While I cannot say what occurred in the intervening years Suchet was absent from the screen as Poirot, I can say it appears to have taken a toll on him. There is a similar toll taken on Suchet that I think I see in the 2013 films, after another hiatus of three years.APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH is absolutely unbearable, though the wife and I are somewhat perversely fond of it. It is precisely the type of derailment that makes some--I say SOME--of these Poirot adventures risky and fun. Here Poirot befriends Lord Boynton (a delightful Tim Curry), suffers Lady Boynton calmly until she croaks, and a generally fun time is had by all ... in spite of the dark corners this film version forces us to see. Keep an eye peeled for Peter Capaldi in the role of the sneaky Scots doctor. Capaldi is now (as of 2014), of course, playing a different kind of doctor.THIRD GIRL I have yet to see--sorry everyone!So here we have this hot mess. The DVD of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS I have suggested for you above is a far more acceptable and even cheerful release (see my review). It has as a bonus APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH, though oddly not THRID GIRL. This is the famous DVD that has as its bonus special feature David Suchet's documentary aboard the real Orient Express. And may I again add that I do not think it is correctly labeled as the 12th season.Save your pennies and get MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. You'll be glad you did. Or better yet: if you cannot wait or you plan to get the whole friggin' shebang that goes back to January, 1989, well, the Acorn Company has bought all things Poirot.

I was pulled in by Gregory Smith who I had loved on EVERWOOD and what I found was a cop show very unique, addicting and very well made.  The show follows 5 rookies right from the very first day they go on the job.  The show is perfectly cast.  Characters are fleshed out fully and you get to know them and care for them very quickly.  We follow the rookies as they learn the job step by step led by their training officers.  The detectives in the department are also given full life here.  This show is a very realistic look at the lives of newbie rookies.All dramas attempt that perfect blend of drama, relationships and slight comedy.  Few succeed but ROOKIE BLUE does it very succesfully.  I just finished watching the first season on blu ray and was very impressed at the character development and depth this series created in only 13 episodes.  After just a few I felt like I knew these people.  Every week there is an intense drama story to be told while the inter-relationships of the squad always stay in full focus as well.  Stand-outs here are Missy Peregrym as rookie Andy McNally and Ben Bass as her training officer Sam Swarek.  Their very strong chemistry and give and take relationship is a big part of the glue that holds this show together.  And Ben Bass hits the screen here as the next sex symbol just as McDreamy did on Greys Anatomy.  But all the other actors are just as strong.  From the biggest role to the smallest, each is perfectly cast.Now to the blu ray.  To watch this show in blu ray adds a whole other dimension over the dvd.  It comes in an inspired 1080p video transfer and the picture is crisp and detail strong.  Colors are vibrant and flesh tones very realistic.  The black/white ratio holds strong throughout the day and night scenes.  This show has many scans of scenery asnd many close-ups of the cast and the blu ray enhances this tremendously.  Action sequences are much more realistic due to the picture clarity.  The audio has a Dolby 5.1 or a DTS HD Master Audio option.  The DTS option is amazing and all your speakers will be in strong use as city noises, gunshots and voices come out of all speakers.  It presents a very realistic listening experience for a strongly dramatic show.  If you can pay the little extra for the blu ray you will be very pleased.I cannot wait for the upcoming second season and highly recommend this show.  It is a truly fresh look at rookie life with characters you care for and stories that pull you in fully.  Intense drama, romance and realistic relationships make this show rise above many others.

The characters are finely developed,as is the plot.  I did not read the actual journals upon which the TV series is based, but according the information available online, the screen writing  appears to have preserved the original author's true intent.The acting in these presentations is excellent.  In my opinion, British actors seem more devoted to performing with highest standard of professionalism, without much emphasis on achieving what we in the US see as stardom,  glamor and notoriety.  They must put much effort into their portraying of each character.  A truly rare skill. I especially enjoy Brendan Coyle's performance.

Perhaps Brits themselves felt at home with this series for the same reason, as I'm sure those American shows were seen on British TV at some point.  Even the landscape looks more American than British.  Hardly a cloudy day, golden fields of barley everywhere, and the fictional \"Candleford\" could easily pass for Topeka, Kansas during the same time period.There must have been a lot of morally righteous fathers raising bright young women in the late 1800s, because Laura Ingalls Wilder and Flora Thompson, who wrote the series of books this show is based on, were writing very similar stories at about the same time (early 20th century) across the pond from each other.  \"Look how simple our lives were in the High Victorian era!  Take that, you Depression-era hedonists, with your cities and automobiles!\"  Our young heroine does not lack for mentors to exemplify, either through lecturing or through their own mistakes, good moral lessons:  that morally righteous father, plus an always-practical mother, and a worldly employer at the town post-office.  Julia Sawalha as the oddly-named Post-Mistress \"Dorcas\" Lane, and Fergus Drysdale as the father, are the acting stand-outs.  This is Sawalha's show all the way.  The show suffers when she's not in the frame.  Not because there's no acting talent among the rest of the cast, but because the characters are not terribly well-conceived.  There's a postman who acts like a child, is terrified of women, then starts beating a bible in high moral dudgeon.  I think he's meant to be comic relief.  Well, he wasn't funny enough.  There's Dawn French as the World's Sloppiest Mom in the \"Lark Rise\" hamlet, who belongs in a modern reality show, like \"Honey Boo Boo\", rather than a period piece.  There are a pair of spinster-sisters who run the local clothing store, who wear the same garish outfits every day.  Some of these characters change from sympathetic to antagonistic, depending on the episode.Lots of comments here praising the \"cleanliness\" of this program.  Yeah.  Just a little too clean, for my taste.  It could use more grit and less silly characters.  I'm also surprised by the rampant sentimentality in a British production: tears hang trembling in bottom eyelids a lot.  Oh well, I guess English people like to cry, too.  But many praising the wholesomeness of life depicted in this show would not choose to go back in time to live in Candleford, and not just because there would be no cell phones.  Class system is in full force here ... and the show appears to believe in that hierarchy, as demonstrated by the local Squire who goes around adjudicating disputes and determining sentences for violators of the law, all with perfect justness, a justness you get the feeling could not be achieved by a jury of peers.  They'd be too hungry from their serf-like lives to devote much attention to anything abstract like justice.Sentimentality's a dangerous road.

Each episode is self-contained, with a resolution or a moral or social lesson. My biggest complaint is that it appears to do what many modern shows do, and that is to take the hot issues of our time and project them onto the people of that time.

Many will agree with that, yet I am not certain it was quite the issue in the tiny villages of England then. I also see socialism and communism presented boldy and favorably all through the series. It was a hot topic at the time, as communism was sweeping Europe. Also, I am a bit perturbed that the two most religious characters in the show are presented as silly and laughable. Watching this show with eyes and mind open, it is a fascinating look into habits, lifestyles, and the daily grind of life for the poor of that time in England.

The central character Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) is a young girl from Lark Rise who is sent by her parents to work as an assistant to the postmistress, the capable and sensible Dorcas Lane (a brilliant Julia Sawalha). Initially Laura balks at the more restrained and formal way of life in Candleford, and is humiliated by the way some of the town's more snobbish inhabitants (such as the Pratt sisters, Pearl and Ruby, credibly portrayed by Matilda Ziegler and Victoria Hamilton) look down upon her, but she gradually finds satisfaction and a measure of happiness in her job and new surroundings, and comes to develop a true understanding of the inhabitants of both Lark Rise and Candleford, in all their complexities. Julia Sawalha is amazing in her role as the kind postmistress who acts as a sort of mentor to young Laura, and whose own life seems deceptively straightforward, despite some undercurrents, brought on by her close friendship with town squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to a city girl,the cool and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant).To delve too much into the plot would detract from the viewer's pleasure, and so all I will say is that this excellent series has everything to recommend it - a wonderful score, beautiful cinematography of the lush English countryside, and plenty of human drama, dealing with social issues, marital strife, forbidden desires, love across the different social classes,friendship, and lots of good old-fashioned humor.The ensemble cast is excellent and a delight to watch, engaging viewer's interest from the first episode till the last of the season, and I was sorry to see it come to an end.

I've seen an A&E; Biography episode about the killer, but it didn't focus on his wife.  There's a news clip on U-toob that does.  There she seemed reluctant to talk, but this installment of \"Who Did I?\" may be a sign that she's opening up.  (I'm a virgin to this show, by the way.)I didn't know that she was married for 20 years before Gary.  She had two kids, and I had no idea she was a mother.  The work says the couple cared for two poodles.  The whole situation reminds me of the wife who ate fat and the husband who ate lean.  Think about a white version of Florida and James Evans from \"Good Times.\"  I wonder how weight issues played into this arrangement and scenario.This work focuses on how signs that pointed to Gary's guilt were ignored or misunderstood.  When the police first came to the wife's house, she said she didn't watch the news and didn't know of the serial killer's evil acts.  This may be a sign to everyday folk to wake up: be political and conscious of the world around you!  He asked for her advice on new carpeting and it turns out he wrapped one murdered prostitute in old carpeting.In the Biography installment, it's implied that Gary killed prostitutes out of revenge for the foreign prostitute that passed an STD to him decades ago.  Here, the narrator said Gary was most likely to kill prostitutes who insulted him (Skills?  Penis size?  Failure to perform quickly?).  This work casually mentions that his wife divorced him.  However, the aforementioned news clip implied that she wants nothing to do with him and wishes he had faced capital punishment.  In that news clip, they said the wife was in disbelief of the police's second visit until she found condoms in her car.  Here, they don't touch the fact that the police searched through the house with a fine-toothed comb.The actor playing Gary in the dramatization looked a little skuzzier than the real Ridgeway.  The real Ridgeway had a nice hairy chest, if you are into that body trait.  One detective interviewed both here and on Biography stated that the search for the serial killer cost the department $15 million.The work tries to end on a note sympathetic to the (ex-)wife.  It said that while he killed during their marriage, his rate drastically decreased.

(They are kept to a minimum, though.)Like most thriller plots, \"The Event\" is driven by the seeking of and the suppression of information. In this case, the titular event is the crash landing of an alien space ship in Alaska with an undisclosed number of extraterrestrial biologicals on board. The series has been criticized for jumping around in time so much. Thrillers of this type always use the plot device of holding back information. There are 2 ways to do this: 1. show the story only from the point-of-view of the innocent character or outsider who is pulled into the situation like Cary Grant in \"North by Northwest,\" or 2. jump around in time to show outrageous situations that capture the viewer's imagination. \"The Event\" uses a mixture of both plot devices.The story opens with the mysterious kidnapping of Sean Walker's (Jason Ritter) girlfriend (Sarah Roemer) from a cruise ship. When Sean looks for her, there is no record of the couple being on board. Like all thriller heroes, be they Cary Grant in \"North by Northwest\" or the current computer hacker Sean Walker, our hero proves to have determination, intelligence, and resourcefulness.The flashbacks are generally clearly labeled and the interrupted continuity is counterbalanced as we begin to get to know the aliens through a double agent (Ian Anthony Dale), who is both an alien and an FBI agent. The gradual revelations in this type of plot rely on being amazing and dangerous enough to hold our interest. So far, the writers have delivered in the first 6 episodes. This type of plot better suits the shorter movie or miniseries length than a TV series. Critics wonder if the series can hold viewer interest long term and have enough revelations to last a season. That is a valid question.If you enjoy thriller plots and sci-fi, you may enjoy \"The Event.\" You may also enjoy: \"The Lost Room\"; \"Heroes\"; \"Sneakers\"; \"All The Presidents Men\"; \"Three Days of the Condor\"; & \"North by Northwest\".", "term": "Suspenseful high stakes game for alien technology", "id": "6704:1_0"}, "6705:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "I did enjoy this show, but I can see why it didn't last,  There were certain lapses in the writing that obviously didn't make sense and which forced certain lapses in the actors' performances because the script did not make sense, but you'd have to have a sharp, critical eye to really notice.", "term": "Regarding The Event", "id": "6705:1_0"}, "6706:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "So many twists and turns.

Shock scene, then three days earlier to backstory the character, then new character, the flashback to explain the new character, then third new character, and so on.  Oh:  and don't take so long to sporadically introduce the opening credits.  That was extremely annoying.Hence only four stars.  The series 'as is', shows that someone was trying to imitate the sequencing in LOST, and didn't understand that sequencing.  Honey, just tell the story in a manner folks will understand.  Don't play games.  The story idea is good, has all the classic elements it needs (primarily, what happens if you are 'different' from 'the masses'), and can be told better.Someone needs to resurrect the show, give it a better name than 'The Event', and if doing flashbacks, do it after a longer sequence which establishes empathy for the (i.e., initial) characters shown.  Maybe retitle it, 'The Nest', or 'Nesting'.  Or even, 'Trapped'.You must establish the viewer's empathy with the characters.  That's why LOST was such a hit.  This series isn't doing that.  It's too preoccupied with action.  But too much stress on action is like an instruction manual on how to put together a complicated piece of furniture: it quickly loses an audience.I got through the first two episodes but wanted to stop watching, even though like everyone else, I'm intrigued by the story idea.  The jumpiness of the scene order, was too contrived and frequent.  Am forcing myself to watch the full season, but unfortunately empathy for the characters, isn't building.  Just too much action without proper link to context.  Stringing the viewer along.When redone, SLOW DOWN the story and first establish empathy.  Stop with the jarring flashbacks.  Maybe start at the beginning of the 96 leaving and how they came to be stranded in Alaska, k?  IF Sci-Fi picks this up, that would be a better place to start.  Can keep it low-budget, obviously.

Some things, however, seem inexplicable - why are the bad guys (whoever and whichever ones they are) so interested in capturing the Jason Ritter character? The acting runs the gamut. Blair Underwood, as the President, is fine as always, though his role doesn't give him much. The man who is in charge of the secret government operation,(I cannot spell, pronounce or remember his name), is really great, as he was as the gay guilt-ridden lawyer in Damages. Jason Ritter, ostensibly the main character, is new to me. He is very appealing, with a kind of puppy-dog sincerity which, unfortunately, does not match up to his steeliness when he is in action. Most of the time, his girlfriend seems more dominant. Lesser characters range from extremely good to passable. Last week's episode seemed to me one of the best, partly because people began acting more realistically sensible, partly because of its deft combination of sentiment with pyrotechnic action.

The show was yet another networks answer to Lost and this one had a real shot at success. The initial ratings were high, leading NBC to pick the show up for an entire season. As has become common place on NBC, after four episodes they took it off for weeks to promote some God awful reality show, and when they brought it back, it was on a new night and the rating plummeted. The Event had a terrific premise and has been called a meeting between 24 and the 4400, I couldn't agree more. 66 years ago, an alien ship crashed in Alaska, and the aliens aboard were not strange creatures, but were in fact nearly identical to us. The only difference being that they age at a much slower rate than we do. About half the crew escaped and tried to peacefully blend into society, but it was hard since they barely age, and often had to re-start their lives. The other group was locked up by the U.S. government until such time as their true reasons for being here could be explained. The series starts when a new President (Blair Underwood) takes office and learns of the prison. His first reaction is that they've never done anything wrong and he's planning to reveal them to the world and set them free, but someone doesn't want that to happen. This unknown force orchestrates this huge conspiracy to assassinate the President, while painting the aliens in a much different light. Most episodes are split into three separate stories that all relate to one another. The White House angel looks as though it could be right out of 24, as it is so similar to what we saw on FOX for 7 seasons. The aliens go from friend to foe and the President and his men, those who are actually his men, will stop at nothing to find the rest of them. The next part shows the aliens themselves lead by Sophia (Laura Innes) who has many different goals that frequently change and surprise you. It's this part of the storyline that I found to be the most enjoyable and interesting part of the show. The third sequence follows an ordinary couple that just happened to get caught in the middle, but may ultimately be the key to this whole thing. The writing for this show is as good as you will see on Television, it's not in quite as much detail as 24, and the timeline can be somewhat hard to follow, but never the less it's very well done. Unusual for this type of show is also the fact that there is no one person who you can call the star. Jason Ritter is the face that is most associated with the show, but he's not more important than anyone else, leading me to believe that his looks have something to do with it. Overall, The Event is another terrific show that was killed by network mismanagement. I sometimes wonder if these executives actually watch the shows they put on the air and realize what they have. There is no doubt in my mind, that if NBC hadn't put it on an 8 week hiatus and then changed it's time slot, that this show would be in the top 10 by now. Instead one of the most interesting shows to come along in years is another Nielsen casualty. For fans of the show, there is still some hope as for the past two years, the Syfy channel has been interested in doing a mini-series, with the possibility of re-launch should the ratings call for one.

Each one I found to be interesting. The comparison that was done on crime rates and availability of legal abortion was the most controversial. It seems, when studying the statistical data, that when abortion is readily available in a state, twenty years later after it becomes available, the crime rates drop. The implication is that, with fewer unwanted children, fewer children have the socioeconomic problems that lead them to commit crimes. Twenty years after the landmark Supreme Court case that marked the legalization of abortion, Roe v. Wade, crime rates in all catagories went significantly down. I feel that this is something that needs further looking into. We know that wanted children usually have much better lives than unwanted ones. Do wanted children commit less crime as a result of having better lives?Of course. This isn't a popular conclusion to draw but looking squarely at this data, there seems to be some truth to it.I thought this was an excellent documentary but I took off a star because the main documentarian, Steven Levitt, had an unfortunate speach impediment that made it hard tounderstand some of what he was saying. Many sentence endings were a fast jumble of mumbled unintelligable sounds rather than words.

While I had a long-standing desire to read the book, I hadn't heard of the concordant documentary and was anxious to see it when I did hear about it.Before I go on, let me regale you with the latest shill's message to me regarding this film: \"It is your assertions of racism, etc. that are anti-intellectual. I could, in fact argue that YOUR discussion of \"Black names\" reflects a rather insidious degree of bigotry. In addition, your criticisms of the quality of the data are amazingly uninformed.\"WOW. Sell a lot of books this way, do you? By insulting an honest reviewer, then demanding back-up evidence? This is a REVIEW, not a doctoral thesis. The idiots who made this film have the burden - not I. Mine is onerous enough writing to audiences filled with readers like YOU. And the filmmakers are the ones who raise the whole issue of \"black\" names, not I. And that is what you can expect from a film like this.The film is a huge let-down; it certainly steered me away from the desire to read the book. I've come to the conclusion that the appellation \"rogue economist\" (as Levitt calls himself) is a big red flag with Sarah Palin's silhouette on it.Full of somewhat interesting but ultimately useless and mildly offensive trivia, the documentary's biggest mystery is why several directors were hired to film the various segments. Some of the segments are downright insulting to the intelligence.In a word, stupid. Or, in another word, Wallywood. So here are the basic parts of this broken machine:REALTORS ROBBING CLIENTS: Levitt and Dubner yammer about the way realtors rip off their clients in the good old American home-selling scheme. While I found it informative, it could have been done more briefly and a lot more deeply.CHILDREN'S NAMES: This is about whether a child's name will affect that child's success later in life. It seems Levitt's whole point is to show how certain names could lead white girls to a stripper's life. I found this segment racist, aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names, and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs. I doubt that is only because of the names the black community chooses but this film insists it is. In any case, I do not need statistics to explain that to me: I am half black.However, Levitt (the apparent heavy-lifter in all the fact-finding) tells us more: did you know that among rich white folk, the most popular names for girls used to be Jessica, Lauren, Ashley, Sarah and Emily? Among \"the Wal~Mart crowd\" (their term, not mine), the most popular names were Ashley (\"Trashley\"), Jessica, Amanda, Samantha and Brittney.I was having a hard time understanding how the white strippers relate to the problems of the black community and vice-versa, but there you are. Apparently, these two stalwart researchers also claim that the name Tyrone \"is a black name.\" I have news for you: it is not a \"black\" name. The only thing in the world that is \"black\" in this context is the skin of some people. And that's not \"black\", it's \"brown\".Gee, I guess pointing that out makes me the racist here.SUMO MATCHES ARE FIXED: Next we have a segment about Sumo wrestling corruption in Japan. Plus the exciting topic about Japanese police and their general incompetence. It's really a segment about religious corruption because Sumo is a sort of extension under the Shinto religion. This was a good segment, but a totally confusing mish-mash if you are not already familiar with Japanese culture - which this documentary assumes you are.ROE V. WADE DROPPED OUR CRIME RATES: These dummies claim Roe v. Wade and the whole abortion issue might just be the answer to lower crime rates. How's that? - you may well ask. Levitt did a study of the evil Romanian dictator Ceaucescu and his draconian you-have-to-have-a-baby-NOW laws from circa 1989. Levitt found that about 20 years later, Romanian crime had skyrocketed. Coincidence?Based on this interestingly weak observation, Levitt decided to study U.S. crime rates dating 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision. He claims he found crime had plummeted. Levitt asserts 50% of that total drop was thanks to Roe v. Wade and all the criminals-to-be that were never born. Allow me to explain why this is bad statistical use: Levitt freely asserts 50% of the drop in crime to be thanks to Roe v. Wade. He presents no evidence that he delved into ALL the necessary statistics to make that assertion.What is freely asserted is freely negated - any critics of my review familiar with THAT? If anyone expects me to quote statistical analysis here for the purpose of refuting these clowns, well, I don't have to do so. The burden is Levitt's. And he fails.BRIBE THE KIDS TO GET GOOD GRADES: For me this was the most stupid segment: an experiment in Chicago to bribe 9th graders to get good grades. The authors of the experiment believed bribes can and should be used to get these kids to do their schoolwork. As opposed to getting out on the street, joining a gang and possibly making several thousands of dollars a day doing whatever it is the gangs do.This type of film pains me. It is the usual pseudo-intellectualism camouflaged as something I can only label as 'significant trivia', and it has more to do with arrogant researchers who are full of themselves than it has to do with facts. Naturally, it deeply moves pseudo-intellectuals. This film tries to be light-hearted and humorous, but it falls flat.These \"experts\" are offensive idiots: they manage to insult the poor of all colors (is that funny?), the black community (oh, that MUST be funny), struggling parents (definitely not funny and most unwise) AND kids in dire need (just plain horrible and psycho). We can safely add that the authors/film narrators in some odd way have made pro-abortion people feel weird also.Imagine how they have offended cinema and the art of documentation.This certainly put me off reading the authors' book. Since I have a little bird who tells me things, I have had it brought to my attention that Levitt and Dubner \"read reviews\". Well, gentlemen, I hope you learned something from my review. The public has a right to know all balanced criticisms.

It doesn't happen often and in today's world where more people are in tune with a visual experience as opposed to a reading one, when it does happen it's wonderful. Such is the case with FREAKONOMICS.Based on the best seller of the same name, the book was written by economist Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen Dubner. It focused on Levitt's research into the causality of numerous topics as explained via economics and tabulated information. The interesting thing, as he states, is that in seeking reasons for various topics people think things are connected to something else but it turns out not being the case. Trust me, its less complicated than you think and easier to understand than you would expect but more so after watching this film.To make a movie out of the book, they chose 4 different notable documentary directors and went to work. Each one has their own look and feel, but all incorporate into the general picture at hand. The first is one of the most well known, Morgan Spurlock who did SUPER SIZE ME. Here he takes on the question of what is in a name.The question here is is a person judged and their life set up early on by what their parents name them? Beginning with the example of a young girl named after Tempest Bledsoe of COSBY fame whose mother couldn't spell resulting in the name Temptress, we find that it wasn't her name so much as her environment that formed her life. But there's more to it than that. The choice of names and how they affect everything from your job acceptance to your place in society is discussed with results different than one might expect.But back to the original premise of the film, where one would think that a person's name might be the reason for the life that the end up with, the truth is that it is more their surroundings. Thus the expectations of people are proved wrong when the facts are sought out.A section on cheating focuses on sumo wrestlers in Japan. Sure, you might not be interested in two big men in diapers fighting one another, but that's not the point. The discussion forms around sumo being a traditional sport surrounded in religion and honor that was corrupted. So much so that the results of matches could be predicted. What brought about this change from honor to corruptibility?One segment deals with incentives and what we expect once more versus the outcome. Here, a group of students are given the incentive to do well in school by being promised $50 each time their grade cards come out if they show improvement and a few other items like attendance. Those that do well qualify for a $500 check at year's end as well as a stretch limo ride. Does this incentive help increase school activity? Watch and see.The fourth section discusses the reported drop in crime rates during the 80s. Politicians spoke endlessly about how they had achieved this, citing the increase in policemen on the streets as the biggest reason. In researching the date, Levitt and crew discovered that police were only a small portion of the reason crime decreased. The main reason, nearly 49% worth, was...well again, watch and see.The movie is well made and follows an interesting path. It starts out simple, discussing selling your home and real estate agents (trust me it's interesting) just to set up the film's/book's idea and then presenting the different theories focused on in an intelligent and still entertaining way.Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it will make you look at the world from a different standpoint. You won't tend to accept things at face value and will look deeper into why things happen. You might even choose to pick up a copy of the book and see how they applied themselves to discover the real answers to some different questions.All in all, the film is a treat, making it enjoyable as well as informative. That's a rare combination to find in films these days. Rare still is the fact that you have a documentary that doesn't preach one political side or another, it just informs.

Most of the stories as brought in the movie actually are condensed and gloss over a lot of the details, in particular the data supporting the seemingly unexpected results from the \"hidden side of everything\". That proves to be a fatal flaw for the movie, even if the movie is not bad as entertainment. The one section that goes further than what is in the book is the Sumo wrestling investigation to explore corruption, and that was foor me the best part of the movie.

I assumed that any such shift in behavior is probably due to complex forces beyond our control.  The claim of the authors, however, is that the advent of Roe vs. Wade and the availability of abortion on demand allowed women to delay childbearing until they were properly able to take care of their children.  As a result, fewer children were born into families that didn't want them, and fewer unwanted children meant fewer people who grew up to become criminals.  I would have to, at the very least, read this study in a journal article and crunch the numbers myself before believing this conclusion--but, at least, this is a conjecture that I have not heard before or considered.Other issues are considered as well: from corruption in sumo wrestling to the tendency for resumes of applicants with archetypal African-American names to be ignored twice as often as those for applicants with typically \"white\" names.

Some things have changed of course. The star looks like 40, not like the queen. And her female cop Jane Tennison struggles against male ignorance among her colleagues on an unimaginable level. No current show would dare to depict men as such stupid idiots.The 200 minutes of the first series are not broken up in hourly or 45 minutes dosages, but come in just two installments. The plot focuses on just one case. It is a whodunnit, but it is also a procedural and a character study and a social study. Tennison is ambitious, selfish, vain, smart, and we see how she has to be better than her male colleagues in order to get things done. Mirren is outrageously good. If I can I will watch the other seasons too.If I have to find fault with something: the mood switch among her colleagues, from rejection of her leadership to total support, comes too suddenly out of nowhere.

But I have other issues that have me rating this three stars, and I was tempted to rate it two stars.First, and most importantly for me, was the constant bickering amongst the members of the police force. It was throughout the series and never let up. To me it shows a lack of leadership and maturity of the lead character Jane Tennison, and also of her bosses. There were several times when I wanted to shout at the TV for her to get smart and bring the team along and into alignment with her, rather than yelling and taking sides without explaining why she felt so strongly about her convictions concerning a case. It just didn't seem wise or real to me.Second was almost every season her boss threatened to, or actually did, pull her off a case. This just got old season after season.Third I felt that 3 hours, in come cases, devoted to a single crime was simply too long to bear. That length promotes what my wife and I call \"filler\" to stretch out a weak story.

A bargain compared to individual segments. If you are just finding Prime Suspect, you WILL want all 7 years.

I know Americans as a lot tend to expect fast paced, action-filled films, but we do and so what? Right wrong or indifferent, Americans' general preferences align to these core values, with some exceptions here and there.  This film, unfortunately, doesn't fulfill.  While I appreciate its attempt to allegorically demonstrate the irrationality of Americans' core xenophobia, I'm sick of the message. Further, good satire, ironic or otherwise, derives its value from being a compelling story on multiple levels, including the simplistic, face-value story presented, through its underlying messages.  This movie is just not that interesting on its face value/level. It does a good job of making the key actors interesting and relatable to the audience, but their journey is much more matter of fact and devoid of conflict, that is just drags on without eliciting the emotional response the film clearly thinks it should drag out.  This is my principal complaint - the actual on-screen action is widely disconnected from the message the story seems to be trying to convey.

These gigantic squid like things have been contained in Mexico by a gigantic wall that runs along the Mexican border.  A young photographer is in Mexico chasing after his big break when his plans are derailed by a sudden attack and the need to escort a young woman back to the States (that young woman happens to be the daughter of the photographer's boss).  Their journey back to the States is littered with oddly placed emotional connections and a few scattered attempts to scare us with brief glimpses of alien creatures.Take away the fact that this monster film hardly showcases the actual monsters; the film itself had major promise.  I mean, I'm all for a film about emotional growth and human bonding in the times of trial.  The script itself, while heavily clich&eacute;d, could have really proven deeply arresting, and the final scene is expertly handled (and by final scene I mean just that; the split second before the credits begin to roll).  Still, there are two things that really prohibited this movie from being any good; Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able.  These two actors are atrocious.

If one thinks in those terms there are some interesting parallels; for example the efforts of the United States to protect itself with a wall. Another would be the infected zones and their parallel with areas controlled by the cartels. The alien monsters had long tentacles which is similar to the tentacles of influence exercised by the cartels. The monsters were most active after dark which also characterizes the cartels. In those areas attacked by the monsters there was much devastation which is also a goal of the cartels. Another parallel are the evacuated zones in the United States; there are already areas of Arizona where citizens are warned not to go, are these infected zones perhaps?I've not seen any suggestions that the allegorical nature of Monsters is intended to reflect Northern Mexico's drug problem but it does make for some interesting speculation.If you are a dedicated sci-fi fan you may want to watch it just so you can say you did or you may want to check me out on my allegory speculation.

This doesn't dwell on the science fiction or even on the massive chaos these monsters bring to the civilized world on a daily basis, but instead focuses on the journey of its two primary characters.  Given that the performances work and the environment was just believable enough, the monsters in Monsters are actually quite frightening.  There's something about giant monsters that calls upon feelings of awe and fear instead of just suspense, mystery, gore, and the other mechanics of horror films.  Monsters could be a modernKing KongorGodzilla, it might even at times work as well as 2008'sCloverfieldor 2006'sThe Host.  However, it is boggled down in making a heavy-handed message that is not only too obvious but by the film's last moments it actually seems to back away from making its point fully, either that or it fumbles in making it effectively.  The ending is flawed for a lot reasons, least of which for me was the fact that Monsters doesn't bring enough of its monsters to the screen, but that is important to note for those looking for a fast paced action yarn.  I forgive that because the movie is overall pretty well done and the special effects, albeit by no means seamless, make due and then some for its extremely modest budget.  The film cost less than $500, 000 to make.  To say that effort made up for the lack of funds is an understatement.A deep space probe from NASA crashes into Mexico and unleashes an army of terrifying alien life forms whose rapid procreation is a major threat to humanity.  The military answers with strikes against the monsters.  Andrew (Scoot McNairy) is a photojournalist escorting Samantha (Whitney Able), a pretty and seemingly unhappily engaged girl whose father has requested that Andrew get her out of Mexico and home.  Their journey is the film's arc and it actually works really well microcosmically, as opposed to the big budget alien invasion films we've seen over the years with stereotypical characters and questionable aliens.Overall, the special effects are effective but at times imperfect.  The performances are very strong and the story works well as a vehicle to make the alien invasion believable.  The constant feel of the monsters imminent attacks work for every scene in the movie and make the film unique and memorable.  It adds suspense effortlessly.  Finally, the film's biggest strength is that it is all shot on location.  An amazing feat for its young British director Gareth Edwards.  He's actually working to reboot Godzilla for Legendary Pictures and given the movies that they fund I'm sure he'll have an extraordinary budget to work with.

Two people, trying to make it across the 'infected zone' felt very much like two people trying to make it across Iraq or Afghanistan. The loss of those who have lost their families to a war machine - this one designed to kill giant Aliens and not Afghans, but the concept feels strangely the same. The pain is the same, no matter if the bombs fall on your loved ones due to aliens or not.One thing I didn't really care for, to tell the truth, was the two people the story is centered on. A horny, self centered jerk of a guy panting after a pretty, rich, spoiled blonde, and a pretty, rich, spoiled blonde. . . the guy is a slimy git, the girl, for all her spoiled nature, was actually bearable in a blonde sort of way.I agree with one reviewer who said, \" . . . Monsters, is a wartime travelogue featuring a social oaf who struggles to find (enough) redemption . . .\" Very apropos. Especially with the very 'wartime' feeling of the whole movie. Especially given the guy who tries to bleed the couple dry in order to find a way out of the Zone.I did love the beauty of the country, and felt that the Hispanic peoples were mostly kind, and happy to help.

The reason for this collapse is an alien infestation rather than an invasion, as alien life forms appeared on Earth by accident. The northern Mexico is the place where they first started to prosper and this place is now a restricted no-go area, where both US and Mexico armies try desperately to eradicate alien invading species.You should not expect a lot of action - in fact there is hardly any. This is a slow film, in which ultimately not so much happens. There are only limited special effects (it was made on a little budget, 800 000 dollars) but in the one scene in which they are necessary they were well done. Aliens can be really well seen only in one scene, but from the little glipses all the long of the film we know that they look very much like cephalopods - but with a little something from Cthulhu in them (although not as colossal as Cthulhu himself).The massif use of well done props (wrecked tanks, planes, buildings, etc.) gives to this film a rather good and quite unique atmosphere. The restricted zone reminded me a little bit the \"ZONE\" from \"Roadside Picnic\", the major Soviet SF classic written by brothers Strugatsky in 1972 and even more the \"ZONE\" from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film \"Stalker\", which is the adaptation of this great novel.This film is basically a \"one man, one woman\" show. The main character, photojournalist Andrew Kaulder is played by Scoot McNairy, an actor I never saw before in anything (or at least I didn't remember him) and he plays very well. But it is Whitney Able who plays Samantha, a stranded tourist who lost her passport, who steals the show with her natural, effortless acting and her considerable \"petite blonde\" charm (quite like Michelle Pfeiffer in her very first roles). Whitney Able is McNairy's girlfriend in the real life - it certainly helped them find the right chemistry when playing in \"Monsters\".\"Monsters\" is not exactly a very good film and it has a lot of weak spots. An enormous geographic blunder will probably make scream all those who dislike plot holes. There is no real ending and I frankly can not say that I understood what was the point of all this... Also, it is slow. Very slow. Very very very slow. One must be in the right kind of mood to enjoy it, because if what is needed is some excitement and action, this film will only frustrate and anger the viewer. But if for some reason you feel like one evening of more \"zen\" SF, this film fits exactly this need.Bottom line, this is a honest, strange and slow, but not bad SF film about, well... something.

This happens against a backdrop of a new life form accidentally released to our planet by a space probe, a life form that is clearly alien and incredibly large. Try to picture a walking 10-story high building with tentacles.More here than meets the eye - and interpretation is open on several fronts.The immigration issue immediately leaps to the forefront. Strange aliens crossing over the Mexican/US border; the call to action to 'defeat' the unknown. The gigantic wall is a fairly obvious stage prop.This message is made clear at the end of the film as Scott McNairy (Andrew) and Whitney Able (Samantha) witness a tender interaction between two of these gigantic creatures. Each singing a different, very humpback whale-like song. I suspect that the director implied that they were male and female, juxtaposed against the main characters themselves. It questions whether or not the danger or \"monster\" exists with the newcomers or within us. As noted by the transport crew hired to take them through the infested/restricted lands, who comment: They don't bother anyone as long as you don't bother them.Another discussion could be life choices. Both characters reflect on what they were doing when they first meet, as each has chosen a life not entirely their own - akin to the aliens themselves. Andy as a father who deeply regrets the choice to stay outside of his son's life. Sam as a young heiress about to become another empty socialite trophy wife.And of course there's the survivalist aspect - the adventure/terror of moving across a landscape that threatens death at nearly every turn.I can see why a lot of horror/action fans were disappointed.

Assigned to protect her and make sure she gets home safely is Andrew Kaulder (ScootMcNairy), a cynical photographer who works for her father. Kaulder would much rather stay and get the chance to shoot pictures of the activity going on, but takes on his responsibility with ease.The biggest part of the film witnesses the pair traveling or attempting to do so to get to the coast so Samantha can make it home. Getting to the ferry is their first problem and once they arrive they find out that passengers are being gouged $5000 for safe passage. They agree, purchasing a place on the ferry for the next morning.

Once upstream, the pair is passed off to an armed caravan that plans to take them to the wall built between the two countries as an attempt to prevent the monsters from moving into the states.

Several reviews I had read prior to watching it described it as a human drama epic set against a sort of alien invasion.  For some reason, I didn't believe the reviews.  I thought that with a title like Monsters, it would be more focused on, well, the monsters.This is not a bad thing at all; quite the contrary, Monsters is an excellent film and one that I am very proud to own.  Gareth Edwards did an amazing job with the film, especially given the supposed budget ($800k, speculatively).  In short, he does a `monster' job with just a little bit of dough (sorry...couldn't pass up the pun).I'll start by stating the obvious:  there ARE monsters in this film...and they're very inventive, behemoth striders that stand two stories above the average person.  And they're scary as hell.  Which is one of the reasons I like them so much.But, true to the previous reviews I had read, Monsters also contains riveting human drama as well.  I love stories like this, where the interactions between the two main characters (portrayed by the beautiful Whitney Able and the talented Scoot McNairy) and the people they meet are set against the backdrop of a potentially terrifying situation.  This adds more realism to the film and also helps set a more serious tone, which in turn forces the audience to take the movie more seriously.The special effects are extremely impressive as well; the aliens, as monstrous as they are on-screen, are rendered so well that you can't tell they are computer generated.  Add to this fact the attention to detail that the production team used, and you have an instant success from a visual standpoint.I also like how Monsters is shot, although I think a couple of the scenes might be a little too shaky for some viewers.  But the chaos that Able and McNairy endure in the film is captured beautifully with the camerawork.While some critics thought the film ended a little too abruptly for their tastes, I feel like it ends perfectly.  Granted, some of what transpires after the credits roll is left to your imagination, but that's not a bad thing at all.  If anything, I feel it adds (in most cases) to your immersion in the film.Monsters is a low-budget film that does not look low-budget in the least.

It tries to get at that sense of the unknown, of a certain dread of the \"other.\" And it feels like it succeeds, near the end in capturing the cosmic ambivalence toward humanity as well as our own limited understanding of what drives/motivates these other-worldly beings. It seems in the final analysis they did pull of that cosmic ambivalence and demonstrate that what we've read as malignity is simply perhaps a misreading of motivations so beyond our own ken that we don't even know what to make of them.But enough Lovecraftian analysis.

How good could it possibly be?Every good monster movie is less about the monster and more about us.  Humanoid monsters like Predators and Aliens are easier to use as a canvas for the worst human traits. But when the monster isn't bipedal the focus shifts to the human survivors.  Cloverfield was more about a love affair rekindled and Super 8 was about a boy connecting with his father.  Sure, there's giant creepy monsters tearing people up, but they're an excuse to tell a good story. And Monsters tells a good story.The plot posits a fast-growing plague of squid-like monsters that walk the land on crab legs.  Invaders from Europa, the Monsters' breeding cycle and physiology are a mystery to State-side scientists, who resort to old-school tactics:  carpet bombing and wall building. It doesn't work, and it becomes clear that humanity hasn't yet accepted that they're losing the war against giant monsters over a hundred feet tall. Our protagonists are thrust into this no man's land between Mexico and the United States in an effort to reach home.Mind you, the characters involved aren't particularly likable. Samantha Wynden (Whitney Able) is a rich girl jetting off to Mexico to avoid her pending nuptials. With her fashionably disheveled haircut and the supernatural ability to look only mildly mussed at any time (her perfectly manicured nails never chip), she's easy to hate.  Andrew Kaulder (Scott McNairy), who is tasked by her father to shepherd Wynden back to the States, isn't much better. He's a photojournalist of misery, cataloguing the horrors left behind in the wake of the monsters that plague Mexico.  When he's not drinking or womanizing, he bumbles through cultures he has no business navigating in the first place. It's bad enough that Kaulder's an opportunistic photographer - he's pretty terrible at his job.  And that's the point. Kaulder makes a living because it's easy to do. The monsters are so terrifying, the destruction so widespread, that it's just a matter of compromising your ethics to make a profit.The characters' flaws are the crux of Monsters.  Kaulder is a disaffected wanderer who misses his son but never returns home; Wynden is helplessly tangled in her engagement when she clearly doesn't want to be.  Will these two lost souls ever find their way home?Along the way, Wynden and Kaulder reveal their secret sorrows piece by piece, until it becomes clear that THEY are the monsters: Wynden is so monstrous to her fianc&eacute; that she tells him she loves him even when it's clear she does not; Kaulder weeps at missing his son's birthday but never makes an effort to be the boy's father.  These two do more damage to the people they love than the real monsters ever could.That Monsters takes such a bold direction, undoubtedly disappointing hardcore monster fans who expected to see people being eaten Cthulhu-style, merits four stars alone.

Shot almost as a documentary, the look of the film is without a hint of pretense yet everywhere is evidence of the dangers to humans from the results of official attempts to destroy and contain the alien life forms.  Unlike DISTICT 9, there's not much metaphor here, but I believed the adventure and was caught up in the plight of the main characters as they traversed a treacherous landscape and explored personal conflicts.  Gareth Edwards directed and essentially created the look of the film, including the creatures, using a laptop and Adobe After Effects.  I've been told the out of pocket cost was about $15,000!

You never find out what the daughter is doing there, but, surprise!  They miss the last ferry, and have to hoof it out (why the publisher father doesn't send a jet down is undetermined).The movie really is about the social and sexual tension between these two.  The \"monsters\" are really a minor part of the story, although they are the background for the plot.  Now, this doesn't bother me too much, because I'm not a horror film fan.  I was more interested in the sci-fi dimensions.McNairy is a very believable photographer.  Able comes across as naive and needy.  The trip to the US border is eventful, with the viewer constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.  But will it?The gigantic barrier at the US border seems more appropriate for Jurassic Park than for this movie, except it has no gate where the road cuts through.

I'm somewhere in the middle myself.  I can see why folks hated it due to the serious lack of monster action in a film entitled Monsters.

Hell, who wants to pay forty bucks for a date, popcorn and soda to go to the theater to watch a story being told through dialogue and/or acting?  Absurd!!Monsters is about a chunk of northern Mexico that has been quarantined off because of an alien species which now roams the region.  A newspaper photographer is given the task of transporting the editor's daughter(who's in Mexico) safely across the border into the U.S.  Well, the journey isn't as easy as planned as the duo encounter numerous setbacks and end up having to travel through the \"Infected Zone\", which is a large patch of jungle.Now, the meat of the movie is the journey of the two protagonists than it is about fighting monsters.  I do have respect for that, some of the best horror films have been more about the human element than the monster.  Romero's original zombie trilogy is a great example of this.  However, my gripe with this movie is that there's really nothing else interesting going on.  To be honest, I couldn't give a hoot less about the plight of the two main characters.  I didn't dislike them, but they just weren't very strong or interesting.  Their travels through the infected jungle aren't interesting either.  Aside from one encounter with a creature, there weren't any real perils for them to deal with.  Before they reach the jungle, they party and go on a pseudo-date in the city, then go on boat and truck rides.  It's kinda like a travelogue of Mexico, and it's not really interesting.  I'm not one to whine about lack of monsters, but if this is the alternative, throw the audience a bone here.The monsters themselves are cool.  They're a kind of giant octopus type thing that Lovecraft would be proud of.  They are CGI, but shown mostly in the dark and don't look bad at all.

Well, she's still got enough of that here, but fortunately has developed other interests like running at the speed of light, which causes her personality on the show to have come up a notch since Dexter. Chiklis as Vic in \"The Shield\" never greatly impressed on the home front in that series, and his work as a father here gets by in similar manner initially as he's run over every which way by his wife, daughter, and son. He's still fun outside the home though. However, while the show's family drama stuff is pretty sappy in the beginning, the scenarios created by each of them having super powers makes for some more than watchable moments anyway. Jim Powell (Chiklis), the father, can jump huge distances, and is impervious to bullets while simultaneously being a mild-mannered sketch artist at the police station. The wife runs so fast you can't see her (but excuse me, I find it hard to beleive vacuuming will be effective at this speed). The daughter, in cliche 'teenage turmoil' can read minds (useful for discovering where super-elite frat parties are going to held), and the son develops into a mathematical genius (suprisingly useful when he joins the football team).No Ordinary Family doesn't start with the promise of greatness, but as the show winds on and the family starts working together as more of a unit, a team, it starts to become more interesting. It's basic plot gimmick was funner than I expected, and the show is somewhat reminiscent of a Spielberg production. \"True Blood\" also comes to mind, though the story is different. Also, the pacing and writing get a lot better by mid-series.It's fun to see Chiklis back in action. I think he had a hand in production as well. His wife in the show and co-star, Julie Benz, also has become more likable since Dexter, perhaps largely due to the part she plays here. As the season winds on, she and Chiklis develop a likable chemistry, and the series develops an interesting story arc that keeps it going and keeps you guessing and even keeps you laughing (sometimes at the silliness of it, sometimes at the genuinely funny one-liners). In spite of its absurdity it maintains the \"what's gonna happen next??!!\" factor. All in all, if you like any of the actors in the show, chances are you may start to enjoy it. I confess I did.

Some of the shows were nothing less than brilliant.Then ... the writers had to react to the cancellation. The producers admitted they knew there was a strong likelihood of cancellation before the second half of the season was in the can. So they had an opportunity to give loyal viewers a clean ending. In this they failed. Many of the episodes leading up to the final show were very good, in fact some of the best of the two years in my view. But the final episode was just pathetic. The writers wanted to supply problems that the crew could not solve. They had the crew not really solving them, but the problems were easily solvable on their face by ANYONE familiar with the \"rules\" of the show. We have the Destiny low on power (again) after a battle (again). The Destiny defeats drone mother ships at not one but TWO worlds, then the crew fails to recharge at either star when they clearly have a window to do so. It wasn't convenient to have the crew take an action that made sense, because the writers were convinced the ship needed to be in a power crisis. Then the crew has to go into stasis chambers, and of course they are short of the number they need. Do we discuss having some smaller crew members double up? No. Maybe that shouldn't work, but the writers should at least be clever enough to think of that and discuss it so that we don't wind up thinking they are just too slow for their jobs.Those complaints only address the plot the writers DID go for, not the one they SHOULD have gone for. That might have been the last Stargate filming to ever occur, and they were quite aware of this. Yet they didn't have enough respect for viewers, some of whom have been faithful to the three series for a LONG time now, to give us a satisfactory wrap up. Instead, they pushed the PAUSE button, and left the fate of one of the most popular main characters up in the air, most probably forever. My wife and I looked at each other in disbelief. She voiced what I was thinking: \"They must hope the fans will campaign for a continuation to find out what happens\". Maybe they are hoping for a couple of follow up movies like StarGate had. It doesn't matter. It was a classless move to treat their fans this way. That's the reason I docked the two stars.In fact, this is just the latest in a series of goofs for the Stargate staff. They killed the original series with the very tedious Auri story arc, and then severely damaged fan connection to Atlantis when they decided to dump Torri Higginson.The writers for \"Chuck\" have found a way to write four episodes (the 13th and final episodes for both this season and last) that doubled very well as season OR series ending shows should they happen to have not been picked up again.

While others feel, similar to the \"Star Trek\" franchise, there are many stories that can still be told.From \"Stargate SG-1' to the animated series \"Stargate Infinity\" and then \"Stargate Atlantis\", here we are with the final season of \"Stargate Universe\", a series that met with fans who were split on whether they enjoyed or disliked the series.  Unfortunately, for this series which began in 2009, there was no renewal for a third season and thus the second season ended with a cliffhanger, just when the series had made some major changes and had gotten better.Should \"Stargate Universe\" had a chance to prove itself?  Afterall, even the popular syndicated series \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" had its haters and also didn't do well initially in the ratings, but given the chance to make the series better, it became one of the best \"Star Trek\" spinoff.  So, I ask the question again, did SG-U deserve to be cancelled?I'm sure that this will be a debate in which these split fans will continue to have varying opinions but the fact is, \"Stargate\" is over and in April 2011, \"Stargate\" producer announced that any plans for continuation of \"Stargate\" have been cancelled and that he had officially packed his desk.  17 years of \"Stargate\" on television and it looks as if this was the final nail on the popular military sci-fi franchise... Or is it?Nevertheless, I have been watching Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper's series and I admit that the first season was OK but the second season was even better.  I do dislike when a series never receives its full run and in this case, ending with a cliffhanger but still, the creators and the fans did all they can to keep the series going and one can hope that the story of \"Stargate Universe\" is completed in someway in the near future.  May it be through a film, animation or even a novel, one can only hold on to that hope.But for the fans who stuck with this series from beginning to end, here we are with \"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" featuring episode 21-40 on five DVD's and each DVD loaded with special features.  It's a great sendoff for the series and while it may not make up for a lack of closure, this set is an appropriate & special features loaded DVD set for the fans of the series!VIDEO & AUDIO:\"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and is presented in Englisy 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As expected with DVD, you're going to see a wee bit of compression, especially since there is a lot of data from the special features and audio commentary included on each disc.It is a shame though that the series that does feature a good amount of detail such as \"Stargate Universe\" will not get a Blu-ray release because this is one series that would look awesome in HD!Surprisingly, the PQ is good for DVD and it helps that there are some scenes that are shot outdoors and scenes with a lot of lighting.As for AQ, there are also some episodes that have a good amount of action and therefore you will hear scenes of explosions and laser blasts but once you get to the latter half of the season, this is where you hear the surround channels being utilized.  Dialogue is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:Robert Carlyle Directs - (4:16) Robert Carlyle (Dr. Nicholas Rush) directs the episode of \"Pathogen\".

In some ways, I am quite surprised that SyFy abandoned \"Stargate Universe\" since the network have been active in promoting the series for nearly two decades.  But a lot of networks known for a certain niche are starting to incorporate different programming and in the case of SyFy, Fridays which were typically Stargate night has been replaced by WWE Smackdown.Granted, it's all business and the fact was that \"Stargate Universe\" lost a lot of its viewers after the first premiere episode didn't help and to make things worse, episode after episode,  none were willing to come back and give it another chance for the second season.  It's unfortunate because the writers did make the adjustment and improved upon the first season.In fact, the talent seemed to gel, you can feel that everyone is much more comfortable playing the character, especially seeing the characters put into a variety of intense situations.  The character development of this series was much better this time around.  I bring up \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" as an example because the first season didn't do all that great and the characters weren't yet as comfortable until that second season and we see it with SG-U, the only difference is that ST:TNG was given a chance and it was also syndicated.It's sad because sci-fi TV series seem to have taken a back seat to vampire series and in the past, we would possibly have seen a network give SG-U a chance to prove itself but in this case, times have changed, business has changed and even the SyFy Channel has changed.So, the question is...who is this DVD for?For one, the fans of the series will surely pick it up as this is one jam-packed DVD with plenty of special features and audio commentary.  And I can only hope that those who were watching the first season, will pick this second and final season on DVD to see how this season did improve.But the fact is that the series ends with a cliffhanger and there is no sight of any conclusion coming any time soon.  But even as a cliffhanger, writing-wise, it was touching of how they utilized Eli's character and sets up things for hopefully something in the future.  May it be in  by novel, movie or something.  And I hope there is some closure for fans...hopefully something rather than nothing.I was hoping SyFy would have allowed the series to tie up some loose ends with a movie, afterall, \"Stargate\" has been part of SyFy for a nearly two decades, at least give those fans who did stick with the series some closure.  But I understand, at the end of the day, it's all business, afterall...Overall, \"Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" was a much better season than the first and it was getting good.  The DVD is a wonderful set and a great sendoff for those who did take their time and stayed with the series from beginning through end and I also do recommend this series for those who stopped at the first season, I'm quite sure they will enjoy this second, final season much more, especially knowing that there is so much included on this DVD set.  Once again, fans will definitely want to pick this DVD Set up!Despite what the critics and hardcore fans of the franchise may have felt towards \"SG-U\", I give credit to the writers for making the much needed adjustments and making this final season worth watching and a final season DVD worth owning.", "term": "(4.5 stars) A wonderful, jam packed DVD set for fans of the series & I enjoyed this second season much more than the first!", "id": "6971:1_0"}, "6972:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I so very much wanted to see a season three but &#34;syfy&#34; channel just had to mess with it and go to wrestling and reality shows, moving SGU around until no one knew when it was on.

(Of course they required the suspension of disbelief that all good science fiction requires.)  The characters were believable.  I particularly liked the super loyal top NCO.  He was hard core and your basic Marine hoorah type although I guess he wasn't a Marine.

Listed as 4 due to no closed captions available in season one or two through the Amazon streaming product.ALSO NOTE: Season 2, Episode 20 Gauntlet does NOT show up as purchased even when the entire season is bought. I called Amazon and they are checking into that for me. I remember that Gauntlet was released as a separate DVD through Netflix, and it may be there is a glitch keeping it from being considered part of season 2Knowing how some series can be pulled without notice, I wanted to make sure that this ALWAYS stays in my Amazon library.So I purchased both seasons and I'm glad I did.I've found this series to be fascinating with very few downsides, except for the vapid and shallow acting of Elyse Levesque in the role of Chloe Armstrong.Then again, perhaps she is being directed to appear vapid and shallow, in which case, she is outstanding.I really HATE Ming-Na Wen in her role as Camile Wray, but I think I'm supposed to hate her, which means she is doing a great job.It took me until the end of the second season to really see the subtle brilliance of David Blue's acting in his role as Eli Wallace.I would have to spoil the story to explain, so I'll let you discover what I mean by maturing character development.Who's the star? For me, it has been a tossup between Louis Ferreira as Col. Everett Young, Alaina Huffman as 1st Lt. Tamara Johansen and the Destiny ship herself.Johansen ultimately gets my vote because of the depth of her character and her amazing screen presence.She never misses a beat.Honorable mention for Jamil Walker Smith as Msgt.

Not that they were bad, far from it. But I never found any of the various spinoffs particularly engaging. Collectively speaking they were lightweight; more entertainment than a serious exploration of space and the potential of truly interacting in a cosmic community. That is until Stargate Universe.And I can see why the show \"failed\". It's the exact same reason why I got into it.Universe was different. A bleak and incredibly realistic approach in comparison to the typical scifi fare. More akin to the rebooted 'Battlestar Galactica' than any of the other Stargate programs, SGU was the diametric opposite of the comic book-like world of SG spinoffs; shows that were for the most part happily populist, predictably linear, and somewhat derivative - in my opinion.To me, SGU was going back to the source, the original film. A fantastical journey grounded in a world inhabited by realistic characters; tangible and fleshed people who weren't exaggerated cardboard cutouts intended for the tried-n-true scifi production line.In fact, you can see how inappropriate the cast of SG-1 was inside the SGU universe.Anytime he was on screen, Richard Dean Anderson's smarmy disinterested Gen. McNeil stood out like a goofy geek at a gathering of Green Berets. Rarely are comic book-type characters feasible on a dramatic stage.In a sense, Universe combined two favorite programs: '24' and 'Star Trek Voyager' with a touch of one of my favorite sleeper hits - 'Defying Gravity'. And I would make this observation: When Scott Ian of Anthrax came out as a fan of the rebooted Battlestar Galactica, he made the comparison between it and Star Trek - by laughing. He said the only thing they had in common was outer space; noting that BG was filthy, grungy, and truly desperate. You could smell body odor, see the tattered clothing, and even noted that he had been to the soundstage that housed the commander's toilet. Up close and personal, he commented that you wouldn't want to sit on it, not ever. That's the difference between SGU and other space faring programs - genuine filth and ugliness. And despite my fondness of Trek, my appreciation for SGU went so much deeper.Universe tells the story of a frazzled and disjointed group of civilians, scientists, and soldiers - forced to seek the only safe refuge available to them by way of a wholly unique planet-sized Stargate. A place quite literally beyond anything any known standard Stargate has ever achieved. The few pitiful survivors just barely make it to what appears to be a starship. But freakishly it's not one that has seen occupants for hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of years.Was the ship abandoned? Who built it? Why? How is it still active after all those years? What was its purpose? And most importantly - how do they get home? Questions that the ragtag group have to figure out.Carrying precious little water, scraps of food from survival rations, almost no medicine, and dealing with what appears to be a spacecraft coming apart at the seams - the group's constant companion is Death. Likely to be a one-way trip for the survivors, that terrible realization only hits them as they begin to settle into the cavernous ship they learn has a name: Destiny. With it, a simmering resentment that comes and goes like an evil tide, forcing them to deal with various factions and changing loyalties; pushing them to determine who will be in charge and what their ultimate goal should be. But not before undergoing mistrust, fear, tumultuous anger, and in-fighting over their stranded isolation.Uncommonly, the cast were completely developed and fully-realized characters out of the gate. Exceedingly unusual, as most know that the first season of any program is often the shakedown phase; actors and writers learning the ins-and-outs of the roles, becoming better defined, and settling in as their on-screen personas. Few shows ever look and feel as polished in their premiere as Universe did, very few.SGU was an incredible and imaginative journey, something I could relate to and - all things being equal - would wish for if given the chance. Typically, the greatest enjoyment I derive from dramatic television is the same reason I enjoy certain novels: I think of myself as one of the characters, picturing myself in the story, so as to better relate to the adventure.Absolutely five stars.

Also unlike the past four seasons I didn't have firm faith in the top few chef's. They were the better preforming chef's but, mainly because others did worse then them. Had they been on any other season, I would have clearer and better opinions of them but they probubly would've been eliminated a lot earlier. Now the drama aspect of the show is still fun and unlike season 2 this season wasn't negative at all but that is what saves the season, seeing Ramsay yell at people.So ultimatly I'm conflicted, on the one hand this is the worst cast in Hell's Kitchen history along with the one of the worser winners, and yet the fact that the season wasn't negative, is funny and the right person won this time makes it somewhat preferable in comparision to season 2 (where the only good thing is the winner).Do I recommend this to fellow fans?

The format is different - most of the show focuses on interviews with people who have had close encounters and experiences with the paranormal, such as the family who moves into a New Orleans home, only to discover it is haunted. The interviews take up most of the show, weaving back and forth between the various family members who have experienced these close encounters, and also friends of the family. Family photographs and actual footage of the places are shown, as well as video footage where applicable, such as video footage of paranormal investigators going through a home or building.There is also some dramatization involved, but not much. At times, the going back and forth between the various people being interviewed becomes rather annoying, and I felt the story itself moved very slowly as a result, and the storytelling seemed choppy. I prefer the format of A Haunting which focuses on dramatization, and feels more like a movie with creepy effects, as I think this format results in a more scary viewing experience.

While the aggressive, unorthodox, down and out cop story has been done and re-done a million times, every once in a while a producer, director, writers and cast get it right (Law & Order, NYPD Blue, Homicide: Life on the Streets, etc.) and with this show they got it right.  Another interesting twist in the series is the unethical and strange, but meaningful and intriguing relationship the main character develops with a suspected murderer by the name of Alice (Ruth Wilson) who, at one point, DCI Luther interrogated.  The chemistry between these two characters is fascinating and could only be due to the great acting these two pull out of their hats!

This character, Luther, is a loose cannon primed to fire at will or by wonder, yet this detective's intelligence and focus seems to keep him charging in the right direction. He and fellow officers appear to work on a rather intuitive level and their ability to relate to us 'common folk' and our reaction to injustice, is a magnetizing factor.The relationship he has with his wife, Zoe, works well as a part of the machinery that helps reveal the different layers of his character. Beyond that, I must admit I feel slightly ambiguous towards her part, at this point, anyway.But I am fascinated with Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson of \"Jane Eyre\" 2006). I had a very good friend with similar characteristics as she; the writers, as well as the actress, portrayed Alice as if they knew my friend intimately. Of course, it is difficult to know the 'deviosity' of which such people are capable, especially when your affections are securely attached through years of shared experiences. As I watch Alice Morgan attempt to secure even the friendship of Luther, I think, \"Oh, go ahead, trust her.\" And then, I remind myself that this character killed her parents! This goes to the depraved depth of the sociopath's personality and how they can manipulate us. Chilling!

It was supposed to be \"wild,\" \"unpredictable,\" and \"unlike anything else on TV.\" I'm not sure, ultimately, that \"Luther\" lives up to such effusive hyperbole--but that doesn't mean that it isn't thoroughly entertaining and compelling in its own right. While \"Luther\" can certainly be wild and unpredictable, it is not breaking the mold of many other rogue cop hero shows that have populated the modern TV landscape. As the titular Detective John Luther, Idris Elba brings much passion, conviction, and gusto to the standard role of a cop who must sometimes cross the line to do what's right. But to the program's credit, Elba can be extremely erratic as well and does push the notion of a \"good\" cop to an uncomfortable, and at times, violent level.Elba, though magnetic, is not the show's primary asset in my estimation. Nor are the actual crimes, for that matter. It's all about presentation. One story line revolving around a cop killer had some quite unexpected and shocking violence. One thing lacking from most TV procedurals are a palpable feeling of tension--of \"anything can happen\"--and \"Luther\" can leave you effectively unsettled. And as the season progresses, that latter episodes become progressively more unhinged. Another routine abduction case was brought to vivid life with a diabolical, super creepy villain and notorious face licker. But my favorite element of the show, by far, is that \"Luther has managed to cast a psychotic murderess in its leading lady role. Ruth Wilson provides a fantastic foil for Elba and I loved every moment of their interactions!As is typical with British TV, this season is short by American standards (some call it a mini-series) with only 6 episodes. But if you like cop shows with flawed heroes battling their inner demons (and who doesn't?), this is an easy recommendation. Not revelatory TV, but dirty fun. 5 HUGE stars for Ruth Wilson. Sometimes, however, I did miss her when she wasn't around and I wasn't always enamored with Elba's domestic issues, ex-wife, etc...But overall, solidly entertaining.

While not particularly credible, the singular exploits of Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) John Luther, make for an interesting and captivating watch, as Idris Elba (Pacific Rim,Obsessed) portrays the brilliant, but troubled and flawed investigator, who lives by his own set of rules.  As aspects of Luther's personal life become more entwined into the criminal investigations, a certain sense of predictability occurs, but there are still a number of twists and surprises along the way, that keep things lively.  Some spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.Series One (2010) contains six hour long episodes, the first opens with John Luther obtaining critical information from a serial killer, and then allowing him to fall, and become critically injured.  With the killer in a coma, Luther is in the clear for the moment, and is reinstated by his chief Rose Teller (Saskia Reeves), and assigned a new partner, Justin Ripley (Warren Brown).  His first case is the investigation of the murder of a husband and wife.  Luther suspects the couple's daughter Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson), and resorting to his accustomed illegal methods, obtains evidence of her guilt, but is unable to arrest her.In a continuing story arc, the relationship between Luther and Alice, two individuals with a twisted sense of morality, strangely evolves from adversarial, to a unique kind of friendship.  It's a weird transition that makes for an interesting fantasy, as Alice take an interest in John Luther's personal life, and his estranged wife Zoe (Indira Varma), who is living with another man.  Alice's intrusion, complicates what was already an emotionally charged situation.Dedicated to bringing criminals to justice, Luther is not adverse to bending the law, or outright breaking it, when he feels it is justified.  While allowances could be made for what he does in pursuit of \"justice\", other actions like covering up a murder, are less easy to excuse.  Luther is often a rousing and pulse-pounding drama, but one without much connection to reality.A highlight is definitely Episode 4, where man who drives a cab, is abducting and killing young women, then arranging the dead bodies on display.  It's been seen before, and the ending is not a complete surprise, but it's nicely presented, and bolstered by some excellent performances from Rob Jarvis as the killer, and Nicola Walker, as his wife.Series One comes to an explosive conclusion with Episodes 5 and 6, which have a connecting storyline.  A group of vicious thieves looking to recover some diamonds, are holding a woman hostage.  The situation is further complicated, because Luther's close friend is involved in the theft.  Things get very messy, innocents die, and Luther faces the darkest of tragedies.  Suspected of murder, and on the run, Luther enlists some unusual allies, as he attempts to clear his name.Journeying to some dark places, reality is out the door very early.  Some things may seem predictable, but the chances are that you will still want to see what happens, as Idris Elba's dynamic performance runs the emotional spectrum.  John Luther is an inscrutable fellow, highly intelligent but also impulsive, deceptive, and accustomed to employing violence as a solution.  He plays with fire, and sometimes gets very badly burned.  At the end, perhaps because he has so little left that he cares about, he's remarkably composed.The supporting cast, which also includes Dermot Crowley and Steven Macintosh, is top draw from top to bottom.  Sociopath Alice Morgan may be something of a genre clich&eacute;, but she is just one of several characters whose role evolves in a short period of time, an aspect that helps make the series interesting.  The Brits have had a taste for murder mysteries and gritty police procedurals for a very long time, and Luther makes a concerted effort to avoid being mundane.  For an American reference, if you are a fan of Criminal Minds, you may want to give Luther a look, particularly if you are a Prime member.", "term": "heavily clich&eacute;d, and sometimes predictable, but Luther is still a riveting and entertaining watch...", "id": "7097:1_0"}, "7098:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "didn't know much about this series but thought what the heck and boy am I so glad I said what the heck LOL....this is an excellent cop drama....love the luther character.....u cant get away with anything with him around....smart character....love him !!!  the whole show is excellent...great stories...great drama....this is a must see show !!!!!", "term": "excellent cop drama !!!", "id": "7098:1_0"}, "7099:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "You won't find your time wasted watching this show.

Kyle's little motto 'In a town full of phonies I am not afraid to be me' If that is true then who cares if its not some gourmet butter? She sounds like the biggest phony on the show.

And now she is attacking Camille. I am not a fan of Camille but I think she has been treated poorly by women and thus doesn't like hanging around them.

So they don't have to constantly worry about what butter their going to buy to impress their guests. So they get to be themselves. I think Kim is comfortable in who she is and this pisses her sister off(because Kyle is not comfortable in her own skin)causing her to lash out at her all the time. I really cry for Kim. She needs to find positive people who understand her. Not people who have nannies and pass their babies to their husbands and then try to offer advice on parenting.

However, episodes like this one are lazy writing, inane, and intellectually annoying.So, Will and his new girlfriend (Abby) are accosted by gang members in order to save their leader's life. The writers of the episode couldn't think of anything else, so they wrote in the leverage that if Will didn't save the gang leader, the second in command would kill both of them. Really?So let me get this straight. The second in command, wanting the leader to be saved by Will, threatens to kill Will, if Will doesn't save the leader? I mean it looks like she doesn't have any leverage at all. Will could simply say he wants this or that (safe passage after the fact, for instance) or she might as well shoot the leader herself, since that's the logical outcome. (The second in command wanted Will to kill the leader by making it look like an accident, but she still had to make it look that way. Killing Will remains an illogical way to achieve that end., and so the evaluation I offer is valid.)What's more, the gang will probably kill them anyway (Will and Abby deduce this). So, in fact, the second in command has no leverage at all.In the mean time, Will concocts  a plan whereby Abby gets free, and while free the first thing Will instructs her to do is call Sanctuary. Abby does get free, and runs back to Will. Her explanation is that she didn't want them to kill Will because she escaped. Again, if they kill Will, their leader dies. Two things here: (1) Why can't she make a simple 20 second call to Sanctuary before coming back and (2) Killing Will is the same as killing the leader, so until all avenues of Will saving the leader's life are exhausted, Will is safe.Very poor deductive thinking and thus poor writing.

And yet, even without much \"wow factor,\" the show was entertaining and engaging to the very last minute - the formula still works. The final choice was a naked, shameful travesty -- we were screaming, throwing things at the TV, but comforting ourselves by muttering that the loser (who was robbed!) will make millions as a celebrity designer, without any doubt.Some changes and trends this season: the three main judges (Klum, Kors and Garcia) were much, much cattier than in previous seasons (although Heidi softened up a bit by the end) and week after week Heidi appeared in some of the worst clothes she's been in to date. In the parlance of the show, her own personal \"taste level\" seems pretty suspect these days. A couple of the designer melodramas were quite striking, particularly the \"reveal\" on contestant Michael Costello, which was one of the most genuinely painful moments I've seen in reality TV.

I would have preferred for Mondo to win.  Although many of his designs were a bit over the top for my taste, he was who I considered to be the most talented.  My wife thought that Mondo's decision to include that white dress with the huge black polka dots in his final collection lost him him the support of Michael Kors, who had been critical of that design in the preliminary round.  But I liked that dress, so I felt that Mondo should have won.  As for the winner, Gretchen, I just did not like her designs.  It seemed like Heidi, though often critical of Gretchen, was always kind of pushing her along and supporting her come what may.  I think that Michael Kors really hit the nail on the head when he characterized Gretchen's designs as having a \"Lady of the Valley\" look.  These sort of loose beige/earthen-toned things were just not what I would consider elegant, sexy, or fun!  I also felt that April, the blond-haired younger woman, was not given enough credit.  I loved her wild black edgy designs.  Andy clearly deserved to be in the final three--I particularly loved his bathing suit in one of the challenges.  In the end I felt that the final three should have been Mondo, Andy, and April.Casanova, one of the real characters in the competition, was fun to watch.  I particularly remember his weird dress that looked like it was about to slip off the hips of the model--and earned a few amusing comments from Michael Kors--who likened it to something appropriate for a belly dancer or stripper.  Michael Costello was interesting as well.  The poor guy was really maligned in one of the earlier challenges--and accused of being unable to sew.  To his credit, Mondo worked very earnestly with Michael in a team challenge which did much to rehabilitate Michael's image.  Michael was wonderful at draping--but I agreed with the judges that he did not belong as one of the final three.  I think that Michael achieved some kind of record low in his reaction to not making the final three.

He understands what the job is about and what type of person could do the job for any length of time without blowing a gasket. The employees themselves are a cool bunch. Most are educated in the arts or philosophy or whatever, and they give a great perspective of the job and the customers.I live outside of Chicago and having had to pay $20.00 for two hours worth of parking, it's interesting to hear these guys talk about customers trying to dodge a $1.50 parking fee. They see all types. The yuppies, the drunks, the entitled brats and every other \"type.\" They see them all day and every day and have developed thoughts and philosophies regarding all of them. They do all manner of things to keep the job interesting and do their share of complaining about the butt-holes they are forced to deal with.Parking is something we only think about when in needs to be done, and then it's simply one of those things that is a stepping stone from where we were and where we're going.

Both McNew (Yo La Tengo) and Beers (Happy Flowers) are ex-employees of the Center Parking Lot in Charlottesville, VA, which Eckman, in her first feature, strives to show as a \"singular\" parking lot. I'm not quite sure I buy its singularity--the mind-numbing boredom of being a parking lot attendant probably drives folks to these kinds of distractions all over the country, though one could argue that the lot's location--across the street from the campus of the University of Virginia (one of those places that gets the \"Ivy League of the South\" tag every time &lt;em>U. S. News&lt;/em> does one of their special college editions)--implies that these are not your average parking lot workers. (Let's see if Eckman comes up with a follow-up that examines an MIT parking lot for comparison purposes!)I'm sure that, given the movie's title and premise, most folks are going to react the way my wife did before seeing it. (\"Seriously?\", with that look on her face. You know the one.) But like many films that examine our working lives, Eckman's piece focuses less on the work itself, which a number of attendants and ex-attendants describe in terms far more vulgar than \"drudgery\", and more on the personalities of the workers, many of whom took the job less as a way to make money than because their friends were working there; at one point, we are told, it got to the point where the guys who ran the lot would only hire folks who were recommended by existing workers, creating an almost cliquish atmosphere among the attendants. Not that there's not already going to be an us-against-them mentality between attendants and drivers; like any area near a college, the number of bars per square block is staggering, leading to drunk idiots attempting to weasel out of their fees. Who are somehow less infuriating than the sober businesspeople who do it at the end of the day. But that's only the tip of the iceberg; property damage seems to be considered a right. The fact that these guys blow off steam by playing games of flip-the-cone rather than resorting to wholesale vandalism is kinda noble (though it doesn't come off that way; they take the \"all-in-a-day's-work\" atttude towards it--which is, of course, just as noble).It is the most fascinating least-fascinating-sounding movie you will see this year. *** ", "term": "A pleasant surprise.", "id": "7189:1_0"}, "7190:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle (which is great) has gotten a lot of mileage out of their unique style of business (Motivational Mojo: Energizing Lessons from Seattle's Pike Place Fish Market,Fish!

The story is about a rich boy, his problematic childhood and subsequent problems. It is also a murder mystery about the disappearance of his wife, whose whereabouts are still unknown almost thirty years after.Sanford Marks (Frank Langella) is a prominent real estate developer who owns several prime properties in NYC. He has two sons, one of them is David Marks (Ryan Gosling), who is expected to join the fathers business but is not interested in it. Damaged and devastated since he accidently witnessed his mothers' suicide many years ago, he seeks life away from the family wealth and finds it in the arms of Katie Marks (Kirsten Dunst). His father displeased eventually agrees to this match and the newlywed couple settles down in Vermont operating a small home goods store. Circumstances however force David to rejoin his father's business and this begins his downward spiral, resulting in the disappearance of his wife and his eventual life as a fugitive posing as a woman in Galveston, Texas.The movie is inspired from the real life story of Robert Durst and this is the films uniqueness. The real life events have been fictionalized and presented in a lively manner. All the actors are top notch, Ryan Gosling excels in another unconventional role and Frank Langella is the evil dad avatar. Kirsten Dunst is the real revelation as she plays the part of a smart but ultimately gullible woman unable to fit in to a world that she does not belong. She conveys the anguish and the destruction of her dreams with such finesse that you begin to sympathize with her. Hers is the best written role. \"All Good Things\" is definitely great in parts and is appealing because they have a ring of truth which probably occurred. I liked it mostly because of the well known cast and some great acting. Three stars. 6/6/2011", "term": "Real life story fictionalised", "id": "7277:1_0"}, "7278:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "This pains me, since there is something within this film that is so amazing I feel it needs to be regarded as such, but three stars, while not awful, is certainly telling to the quality of this film as a whole.Does that make sense?First, the movie.  The film follows the true story (as much can be true in a film `inspired' by real events) of David Marks, a troubled young man looking for ways to rebel against a family that controls his every move (subconsciously, which is the best way).  When David meets and falls for Katie, it seems as though his life may start to iron out.  He walks away from his father `real estate' clutches and ventures off into a life all his own with Katie, but darkness erodes all happiness when David allows his father's manipulations to reel him back to New York, back into life in the Marks' family.  All tumbles downhill, rather rapidly, when familial tendencies begin to separate David and Katie until, one day, Katie disappears.For me, it is this point of the film where things start to just derail.  I understand the whole `inspired by real events' angle, and so I encourage even the bizarre, but the `made for TV' way in which the films later scenes are shot take away from the terror one should feel and actually gives this film a `Lifetime' movie feeling.The film does a 180, from decently engrossing thriller to complete disaster.So, this leaves one thing to be discussed...the very reason for which the films first half is so stellar; Kirsten Dunst.  I recently wrote an entry for my blog about the amazingness that was Kirsten Dunst in this film, and so I'm just going to quote that here (slightly doctored to reflect this review and not the article I initially wrote).\"Then we have Kirsten Dunst, who just marvels with all sorts of layered emotional relevance in `All Good Things'.  Talk about a brilliant performance in a really bad film.  Kirsten plays Katie Marks, a real person (come on Oscar, why aren't you biting) who disappeared, `allegedly' at the hands of her deranged husband.  The one thing that Dunst's character, and performance, has (in spades) is serious emotional collapse.  One blogger mentioned that you could see Kirsten visibly age as she uncovers the truth about her husband.  I totally concur with this explanation of her devastatingly real performance.  As she slowly uncovers realities surrounding the family she's married into, you can see a hollowness erode her beautiful features.  She remains human despite the dramatic overtones (she never resorts to Hollywood's overtly obvious understanding of melodramatic `emoting') and delivers a quietly natural performance.  When she does unleash her suffering, it is with haunting desperation.  She completely collapses within her character's knowledge.  It's just a shame the film collapses the moment she leaves it.\"Yeah, that pretty much sums it all up.  She acts circles around the rest of the cast, including Ryan Gosling, who suffers from poor character development (the script seems to skeletal when all is said and done) and really bad makeup.  I wish I could say skip the film, but you need to at least watch the films first half.  The moment Dunst leaves the scene though, you can take your exit as well.  The film just can't recover from such a tragic loss.", "term": "Not that good, but...", "id": "7278:1_0"}, "7279:1_0": {"polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This is a really terrible movie.  Let me describe it by splitting the film into two sections.  Let me explain the first half first.The first half of the movie is totally fitting for the Lifetime Movie Network.  It's about a woman who lives in an apartment building and, while a man is fixing a plumbing problem under her kitchen sink,  they fall in love.  Little does she know the man who has a history of mental illness.  Well she DOES eventually realize this but not until she's already committed to the guy.Let me state that what the guy does for a living is completely meaningless.  He works in real estate and it's a family business, hence the constant sarcastic bickering between him and his father about \"making the right choices for the sake of the family\".  None of this matters though.  The focus here is on the man and woman attempting to hit off a relationship.Well for the entire first half of the movie, the man and woman go through the routine ups and downs of being in a relationship, however since the man has a mental condition due to him having to tragically witness his mother jumping and killing herself when he was a child, this problem interferes with his ability to want to have kids with the woman and... now things get worse- MUCH worse.  Apparently the woman brought back personal feelings that weren't meant to see the light of day.  Now these mental problems have been unleashed.  Sounds fun so far, right?  Read on.Let me mention that everything about the man and woman falling in love is flat out *boring* because I've seen an identical build-up of typical relationship highs and lows in several other films, so nothing different was done here at all.  I mean it was written in such a predictable way here that it's totally pointless to watch.  In fact the one and only scene that made an effort to stand out and be different is when the man gets furious at his wife who's simply minding her own business at a dinner party and he comes storming in the room, grabs her by the hair and pulls her out of the house.  Nobody at the party seemed to think this was unordinary behavior or stood up for the woman.  What?Even worse is that whenever something good happens such as this, the writing completely falls apart so the very next scene shifts in another direction, thereby destroying all suspense that could have occurred.  Terrible.  It's obvious the man is crazy but nothing really suspenseful other than the guy destroying a book shelf and making a few threats ever seem to come out of it.Now the second part of the film.  This is when the storyline completely falls flat.  This is when the amount of confusion will probably leave you speechless.  Well apparently the wife disappears, so we flash several years into the future with the husband as an old man, in a courtroom, and attempting to explain his innocence but... now the storyline is completely focused around the characters as OLDER people so suddenly it's like watching a completely different movie, and... get THIS- now we're seeing the man accused of murdering his wife dressed up as a woman *himself* and involved in conflicts with other older people that do absolutely nothing but confuse the living heck out of me.Suddenly MURDERS are now occurring, which is odd because you'd think growing older would mean becoming wiser and less violent.  Suddenly as an old man, he's doing drugs with a friend in a car and wearing make-up like a woman.  Whatever (or whoever) is responsible for these murders being committed when it would seem these characters don't have much time on the planet anyway since old age has creeped in is beyond my understanding- WAY beyond it.Bored by the generic writing of the first half and confused by the second half makes this movie an absolute failure.  A double dose of failure in fact because \"bored and confused\" is the worst of BOTH worlds when it comes to movie storytelling.  Ugh!

We know something is wrong with the family right from the start by seeing their home movies where the mother walks away from him as a child and then kills herself. Also, the father has virtually no redeeming facets.  He is a sleazy real estate operator who has always been solely out for himself.When the son meets his future wife, played very well by Kirsten Dunst, he seems like he is a handsome, charming, wealthy young man who she is very fortunate to marry.  The accent is on the word seems because at that point he doesn't look anything like the freakish character he will become. By the time we get to his living in Texas and walking around there as a woman and then to his giving testimony at his trial, we know he is one mighty strange guy.But did he kill his wife?  Did he not kill his friend down in Galveston in self defense?  Did his friend kill a woman friend of his in LA at his direction?

He plays David Marks (based around the real life Robert Durst), a young man from a wealthy New York real estate family.The story starts off simple and fairly slow. Marks meets Katie (Kirsten Dunst) and they fall in love. They move to Vermont to run a health food store called All Good Things, however they soon return to New York after David's father's urges for him to be a part of the family business. It's at this point things start getting interesting. Once David and Katie get married, things really start getting strange.David soon shows signs of some kind of mental disturbance. From talking to himself, to distancing himself from Katie, it's clear that something isn't right. Gosling handles the many different sides of David with eerie accuracy. The bouts between David and Katie are emotional and intense, which really start to set the tone for the rest of the film.The chemistry with Dunst and Gosling is great (well, despite the dark circumstances that take place). I can't say Kirsten Dunst has done a lot to get my attention since The Virgin Suicides, but in this film she did an excellent job and really had me feeling for Katie. Similar to my response to Gosling and Michelle Williams in Blue Valentine, Ryan and Kirsten really have me believing they are a couple with serious marital problems.This is far from just a relationship gone wrong drama, however. We see glimpses of shady real estate escapades in the background as well as a status-loving family and the pressure that can have. The second half of the film also turns into a dark crime mystery with multiple murders and curious hints placed throughout different scenes. All of these events comprise a bizarre character study that is even more fascinating when considering the facts of which it is based.I found it surprising I haven't heard more about this film, especially considering how \"in\" Gosling is these days. The film is solid with great directing and cinematography, and a top notch cast. Perhaps a lot of people don't enjoy a slower burning drama that builds up character development and story and would rather have the good stuff dished out to them right away. Or maybe I'm just partial to a good dark crime thriller based on real people and events.

Be that as it may this is a good show. It's an interesting story, based on an unsolved case, and the film makers are pointing fingers.Here's the scoop. Ryan Gosling plays the stoner son of a prominent New York family who owns a lot of sleazy property in mid-town Manhattan. He meets a girl (Dunst) who is \"not one of them\" and they marry. He's not into the family business but is drawn back in and does low level collecting of money from their various nefarious property owners. She wants a kid. He doesn't. He's unbalanced due to witnessing the suicide of his mom as a child. Next thing you know, Dunst is Missing (dead) and he does his best to disappear.This is a good movie. Not great. But it has so much going for it it reads well. First off are the performances. With Gosling, Dunst and Langella as the main three characters, the acting is great. Kristen Wiig is good but her role is very small. Phillip Baker Hall does his usual great character part. All the secondary characters hold their own as well. As the movie spans the years from 1971 to (I believe) 2008, great attention is payed to sets, wardrobe, hair styles, music, etc. It's a very interesting story as the producers/writer/director are saying how things went down even though the case has never formally been solved.Gosling's character is not right in the head. You get hints of this throughout the movie, but in one scene, where he goes over the edge is truly unnerving. Dunst plays a Vermont girl who likes her new life but realizes things are going south.

It is both a love story and a missing persons/murder mystery based on a still unsolved case that continues to haunt New York investigators and reporters and detectives. What writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling have created from known and newly discovered facts, speculation and court records results in a psychological examination of a powerful New York family, obsession, love and loss. The film relates incidents that began in 1972 and end in 2003 and at this time the truth is still unknown. Director Andrew Jarecki uses a superb cast and a fine sense of voice-over narration to interweave the puzzling history with the gradual dissolution of each of the characters involved.Sanford Marks (Frank Langella) is one of the wealthiest owners of Manhattan real estate, the current head of a family that has long dominated the New York scene with its power and money. Marks is aging and is relying on his son David (Ryan Gosling) to take over the family business: he sends David out to the brothels, and filthy hotels and porn houses to collect rent. David is reticent to be a part of his father's business: he is a deeply disturbed young man, having witnessed his mother's suicide leap as a child. David meets a tenant in one of the properties - Katie McCarthy (Kirsten Dunst) who longs to go to medical school but at present has no income to support that dream. The chemistry between the two is magnetic and despite David's father's objection that Katie is not of 'their kind of people', David decides to marry Katie and move to Vermont to open a Health Foods store - a move that makes the couple ectsatic, but is financed by Sanford Marks who eventually convinces David to sell his haven and move to New York to stay with the family business.In their Manhattan home (and in their country lake front home!) the couple flourishes until Katie mentions she'd like to have children - a force that drives David back into violent behavior resulting form his witnessing his mother's suicide: David can't understand why Katie would want anything but the obvious life of wealth they enjoy. The shell is cracked and the subsequent events include Katie becoming pregnant only to be forced by David to terminate the pregnancy, Katie's disappearance after uncovering the facts about the sources of wealth of the family, David's descent into drugs and irresponsible behavior, and ultimately his leaving New York for Galveston, Texas where he lives a life disguised as a woman, his only friend being another old runaway Melvin Bump (Philip Baker Hall) who David engages to do away with a 'problem confidant' (Lilly Rabe), after which Bump is killed and dissected and tossed into the river. The murders are never solved nor is the mystery of Katie' disappearance. A trial (the source of the voice-over throughout the film has been the lawyer's interrogation of David in the year 2003) fails to resolve anything and the film ends with the message that David Marks is at present a real estate broker in Florida.Frank Langella is superb as the heartless father who drives his family like cattle in the quest of power and wealth. Ryan Gosling offer a multifaceted performance of the deeply disturbed David and is match by Kirsten Dunst's bravura performance as Katie, the simple bright girl whose life is quashed by a powerful family's sickness. The brilliant cast, including the performances by Philip Baker Hall and Lilly Rabe - daughter of the deceased Jill Clayburgh), has excellent cameo roles by Diane Venora, Trini Alvarado, David Margulies, Nick Offerman and many more. This is a tough film to watch because at the bottom of it all is that it is true and the cases are unsolved.

Inspired by the life of Robert Durst, this story tells the tale of a real estate heir whose wife disappears. This film is based on a real unsolved mystery and provides speculation of what may have occurred based on tons of research, interviews, and a lengthy courtroom transcript.David and Katie begin in love as opposites attract, him being from a rich family and she being a working class student. They move away from the city and try to open a health food store but are lured back by David's father (played by Frank Langella) to join the family business. David talks to himself often and witnessed his mother's death at a young age. He views Katie as the perfect woman because he could do anything and she loved him. Their differences come between them about whether to have children and Katie's desire to go to med school and two months away from graduation when she contemplates divorcing him, she disappears.Ryan Gosling was an excellent casting choice for the role of David because he can show some charm and justification for why a girl might fall for him (as in \"Blue Valentine\") and then flip it on its head and explore all these behaviors of the character as he gets progressively more disturbing. Kirsten Dunst as Katie is a charismatic beautiful young woman who can instantly put people at ease and transitions into a lethargic emotional mess over time. They have good chemistry together and sell that the couple was in love initially before things got complicated. What is most intriguing about the film is David's behavior AFTER Katie's disappearance when he goes into hiding dressing in disguise.This film was pushed back several times after being filmed in 2008 and slated for a release in 2009 and finally ended up in limited released in December 2010 and is now coming out on Blu-ray and DVD. It is strange that this story about a relationship that doesn't quite work anymore didn't catch any attention around the same time that \"Blue Valentine\" was released which got lots of attention for Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.Bonus Features:All Good Things - Truth in Fiction is a half hour feature that reveals how much of the story came out of courtroom documents from Bob Durst's testimony. They gathered together several sources and interviews to try and piece together a 360 degree view of what may have happened in speculation. Some of the dialogue in the film is directly from these interviews. They researched for two and a half years before starting filming. Kirsten Dunst met with the Durst family and learned a great deal about her character. There is twenty minute feature called \"Back in Time: Researching the Original Story\" that shows clips of several of the interviews done to research the film of actual people who knew Robert and Kathie Durst.There's an interview with director Andrew Jarecki where he talks about the interviews they did in researching the story and how they put them together in documentary form to show people as they created the movie and to remind themselves during the writing process. It's a VERY thorough interview where he talks about everything with the movie and goes on for an hour! There is also a sped up video of the process of aging Ryan Gosling to play David Marks in his later years. There are only a few deleted scenes, one washing dishes in the kitchen getting to know Katie's mother, another showing Katie training in the medical field, Katie confronting David about Polaroids she found, and David trying to get food stamps in a tuxedo which is very weird.There is full-length commentary with director Andrew Jarecki and writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling. There is also commentary with the director and Robert Durst whom the story is based on so of course after hearing all the background on this story and the interviews, I couldn't resist hearing what the actual guy says about this movie based on him. He verifies that Frank Langella's portrayal of his father is spot on and expresses regrets about how he treated Kathy's family and how rude he was. Every comment is prompted by the director who is interviewing Robert as the film progresses. Each scene that plays out, Andrew asks Robert if it was like that and Robert usually confirms it (or it sounds even worse than the movie plays it to be). He indicated that they were both unfaithful to each other late in the relationship (not covered in the film).

The film then starts to focus on his involvement with a second-tier character that overshadows the real questions raised in the first half.

I mention this in preface to talking about the fascinating feature \"All Good Things,\" a film by award winning documentarian Andrew Jarecki, not as a negative association--but as an incredibly positive note.  \"All Good Things\" employs everything that has been overdone about this genre, and despite the familiarity in story telling, stands as a richly intriguing and superbly acted drama.  In truth, I loved \"All Good Things!\"Based on a real New York missing person's case involving a wealthy and powerful real estate family, \"All Good Things\" introduces us to the Marks clan. Ryan Gosling plays David Marks who has little interest or patience with the family business.  Meeting a young woman, Kirsten Dunst, completely removed from the society set he's been raised in--he sees her as a possible escape.  But happiness is fleeting for the couple as Gosling is eventually brought back to deal with the seedier elements in his father's empire.  The couple's relationship becomes increasingly strained until Dunst disappears.  Investigated, yet unsolved, what happens remains a mystery until an ambitious District Attorney 18 years later decides to pursue matters further.  That's when things start to get really strange!Of course, when you've got master actors at the top of their game--that certainly brings a welcome gravitas to the proceedings.  I have, for many years, declared Ryan Gosling perhaps the best actor of his generation.  Ever since he burst onto the film scene in the controversial \"The Believer,\" Gosling has eschewed being a mainstream \"star.\"  Heck, after \"The Notebook,\" another actor might have taken a very different career path.  But Gosling, despite a couple of disappointing forays into big budget Hollywood, has remained true to his indie roots.  In \"All Good Things,\" Gosling is riveting--a socially awkward powder keg, he is strangely likable AND dangerously unhinged.  It's a great, fully rounded performance.  Kirsten Dunst, as his wife, hasn't been this good in years.  An intriguing blend of strength and vulnerability, she becomes the heart and soul of \"All Good Things.\"  And the terrific Frank Langella is mesmerizing, and filled with oily menace, as Gosling's father.The film is also great-looking, with its use of shadow and darkness.  The score is fantastic as well--so haunting.  The first two-thirds of \"All Good Things\" are absolutely flawless.  The pairing of Dunst and Gosling and their story together is as polished and entertaining as anything you're likely to see this year.  However, when the film fast forward--it does suffer by comparison.  This is where the story becomes utterly bizarre.

This has steered his life forever off track from what is expected of him: A stoic strength of character which is always demanded from his hyper-controlling father.  All of his life, this is what is forced on David without exception. He is the eldest and will be required to carry on the family's crooked high-grossing real estate business from a certain point onward. He is being groomed in the business from the outset. David does not argue with his father as concerning him there is no gauntlet to throw down, while he follows orders in an almost robotic fashion. He is always being mercilessly put-down as a weakling in front of others or shamed while alone with his father.We are introduced to David, on the way to a high society function. Decked out in a tuxedo after returning from a call for his father. He must go to fix a leak at an apartment their family business owns  because his father is just cruel enough to have David do it in lieu of a contractor. This is when he is much younger. In the early seventies and rebelling just a bit although David cannot totally. He walks into the apartment of his future bride Katie (Kirsten Dunst giving a knockout performance).  David's father does not approve of the relationship or subsequent marriage as she is not 'one of their people'. She dreams of going to medical school and becoming a doctor. Also wishes to have children with David after they are married and open a health food store in VT. Of which they do and are blissfully happy then without the pressure of David's father. He soon shatters their happiness and coerces them to move into a big-money apartment.They are still in the first bloom of their love when Katie announces that she is pregnant. Unfortunately they did not discuss this issue before marriage. Katie is shocked when David finally tells her he never wanted nor wants to have children in the future to Katie's complete devastation. A full reason for this rationale is never offered.  The often disjointed way of thinking that David suffers from really starts to become more apparent here. Consequently Katie must handle the pregnancy issue herself and she is never the same after this horrendous event for her. In fact nothing is ever the same and the plot of the movie begins to get sketchy, that is if you don't already recall this incident in history.I don't want to throw in spoilers to the movie so I'll try to end this part rather vaguely. It is at this point where Katie disappears. David apparently suffers a type of mental breakdown or calculated state of rage that throws his life out of control. The writers make both seem plausible through the narration that continues throughout the movie from the outset. David is talking while on the stand during his trial in 2003 from the beginning of the film.This is a completely engrossing movie, extremely psychologically eerie and superbly acted by Gosling and Dunst. He is such a multidimensional actor to be able to make this unusual role seem so real. When the film ended I felt like I was sort of in shock for what had happened here with Katie. Also for the anguish in this terribly damaged man suffering because of his father's cruelty marking his entire life.  The film could have made itself much more gory or bloody although it took a more cerebral approach. It shocked or scared you with your mind  because it's real. There are a lot of unanswered questions still involving this real case. If you enjoy frighteningly surreal crime dramas or off the wall and unsettling relationship stories, this movie may appeal to you.", "term": "One True Shocker Of A Story ...", "id": "7309:1_0"}, "7310:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I watched this movie late one evening, not really knowing what I was getting into. I couldn't stop watching it, as it's similar to a train wreck: very disturbing yet captures your attention to the point where you can't turn away. It is a well acted, solid script. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even more disturbing yet intriguing to watch. Ryan Gosling did an excellent job in the lead role.

But I digress as this film was one of the most meticulously researched \"true story\" films I have had the time to find. Jarecki impressed me with the volume of time and material he put into this, and I think if even the critics of this film watch the supplements they will have an alternative viewpoint of this whole project.The picture quality is great, albeit the clarity overall is not a benchmark as Jarecki uses a great deal of darks, retro-footage and varying focus points. The DTS is crisp, but the outer channels are mostly score heavy (which haunts the scenes just right), with the stand-out exception of the thunder during the murder scene (excuse me, disappearance night). The story appears to be a solid theory of how Durst's life might have transpired over those thirty years of friends and lovers being killed. The supplements are outstanding and include:* Deleted scenes, 4 @ 5:21 minutes. Low-def, glad they were cut as they seemed out of place.* Truth in Fiction, 26:07 minutes. A documentary about the process in researching this film and finding as much of the truth as possible. The amount of self-accolades and how great everyone is to work with (which I loathe) did not really hit until the 18-minute mark. Worth the watch.* Back in Time, 22:48 minutes. Interviews with all of the real people associated with these crimes and the overall story. Worthy of a History Channel presentation with all of the material presented. The detective's answers to why he was re-assigned and how he evades blurting out all that is wrong with this case (at the 20-minute mark) is priceless - worthy of another film about what is not being said. Absolutely worth the watch.* Beneath the Surface, 60 minutes. A very articulate interview with the director. He reveals all there is to know about the production, story and background on this film. Good insights and does not feel too long even though it is a talking head format. I would say watch this one last so you have all of the information going into it.* Wrinkles in Time, 1:44 minutes. A fast-forward clip on Gosling getting the make-up applied for his advanced age scenes.* Commentary with Jarecki and the producers. Informative, but I preferred the other supplements regarding the actual material and filmmaking.* Commentary with Jarecki and Robert Durst. WOW. I cannot think of any instance in movie making history where the person whose life is being depicted (and is most likely the serial killer) is talking on a commentary track. I spent hours watching and researching this story, but I still found a way to listen to this guy talk about what he was seeing in the film - and how accurate Jarecki had made things. Selfishly I had wanted to hear this guy finally admit to it, but his lawyers had already not allowed him to participate in the documentaries, so I am sure this was planned out to the word. Still, for serial killer researchers this might be a track to play. His voice sounds identical to Pacino's role inDick Tracy.This will be on my recommendation lists for so many reasons, but most of all the actors did an amazing job fulfilling the roles of real people and the BD holds all that one would want to know about regarding this story (except for an ending of the bad guy being caught).

So far that has been the only segment that showed promise in either debunking or proving that there is paranormal activity around us.The rest of the episodes that I've watched so far are VERY easy to explain ( orbs = dust particles, insects or fibers/pet hair reflecting off of the light, floating apparitions = breath condensation outdoors, furniture moving and snoring or growling noises in abandoned home = feral cat or wild animal using home for shelter, the golden ghost in the window = flashlight (backlighting) shinning onto only curtain in the house and so on.

Most of the floating images around the outdoor cameras are moths (the wings can be seen flapping and the flight patterns are typical of moths) yet the bar's owner states that they are not and were verified not to be insects. The security company wasn't brought in to confirm or deny the claims nor was the local media present or questioned as to what their findings were. WHY?

When they run out of tags, theirseason is over. If they don't use all their tags, then the state cuts their allotment oftags for the next season.

Some episodes switch back and forth between two different criminal investigations and others address a single incident. The episodes take place in different locations and feature homicide detectives in the area. Emotions run the gamut from tragic to humorous. The narrator gives both a description and an explanation that is easy to follow. If you like this genre, the portrayal and cases are well presented.

The Ikemoto family and the Murase family are in the middle of a war as the chairman the two crime syndicates answer to continues to pull the strings. Sekuichi (Kitamura Soichiro), the boss of the Sannokai, tells his right-hand man Ikemuto (Kunimura Jun) to put the Murase family in line. Since Ikemuto and Murase (Renji Ishibashi) are still under their pact at this point, Ikemuto passes the assignment onto his subordinate Otomo (Takeshi Kitano), who takes matters into his own hands with his own gang.I probably have a fairly limited amount of knowledge when it comes to Takeshi Kitano's films since I've only seen a handful and have yet to see his most prestigious films. With that said, I've seen enough to know who the guy is, admire his work, and at least look forward to his upcoming projects. When it came to Outrage, it seemed like an undiscovered gem right from the start. Another yakuza film made and starring Beat Takeshi? It sounds like the type of movie you'd willingly pay whatever price for without blinking an eye. That isn't really the case though as Outrage fails to really leave a lasting impression.Walking away from Outrage, you'll probably only be left with its bloody violence and not much else. Everybody was chopping off their fingers left and right to apologize. It was amazing so many of these guys still had any appendages left at all. But the violence gets pretty vicious at times; a box cutter to the face, countless people getting shot to death, chopsticks being used in a fairly unique way, and it even features one of the worst ways a dental appointment could go. Other than the brutality though, all of the events that transpired felt very underwhelming due to them being similar to most other gangster and yakuza films out there. Nothing was shocking or unpredictable; it all felt very safe. Most of my yakuza film watching experience falls under Takashi Miike's filmography. Miike is able to make a film about anything and take it in a direction you're not expecting while adding his own trademarks to it. While Outrage felt like a Takashi Kitano film, it didn't really seem like anything he hadn't already accomplished before. It almost felt recycled from both his films and other films similar to Outrage. The film also lacked any sort of supporting female character as most women in the film were used as props or were disposed of rather quickly. It's incredibly disappointing as well as Outrage had loads of potential, but was never really able to push anything past that mediocre barrier. Its use of perspective is intriguing at times, but doesn't make up for a film that comes off like it isn't willing to take any risks.It's not so much that Outrage is a bad film because it isn't. It's actually a fairly solid crime film. Its biggest issue is that it fails to live up to expectations given the cast and Takeshi Kitano's reputation for being a part of films that are generally a lot better than this. Outrage tends to feel very familiar. If you've seen a gangster or yakuza film before, then you know what to expect with Outrage. With its explosive use of violence and rather eye-catching cinematography, Outrage isn't the type of film you should make a high priority to go out of your way to see but is generally pretty decent once you do finally get around to it.", "term": "Decent, but feels mostly like wasted potential", "id": "7558:1_0"}, "7559:1_0": {"polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Watched this expecting some decent acting and some decent action, not because of the user reviews but because of the stock Amazon review, but all I got were some pointless brutal killings over small potatoes.

It is a very serious horror movie and is actually a little creepy.Riffs: Mike and the bots do provide a lot of good riffs.  The riffing was sometimes sparse but then again this movie did not have too many elements that would lead to quick and easy riffs.Host Segments: The ones involving the SOL crew were hilarious!  I won't spoil any of the jokes but a character from a previous show makes an appearance.  As far as the mads, this is when they were in Ancient Rome.  Their segments are mildly amusing.Overall: Take a well made horror film, thrown in some very funny segments, and add some good riffing - and you have a very good MST3k segment.  This one is not a top 10 (or 20) episode but it was a nice change of pace to see the guys riff on a non-cheesy and non-campy film.Other:  Be sure to watch the crew silhouette when they watch the movie.

First, Brad Meltzer. Why does he need to stand in front of a field of mathematical formulas as if to suggest he is a higher order of intelligence when nothing anyone does has to do with math?

He has this team of \"experts\" who are totally laughable go out and \"discover\" the truth. One guy is writing notes the whole time (scribble scribble). The chick usually has nothing to do. The other guy is the driver who seems like he is still learning his job.Most of the time in their investigation, they take some red herring and find themselves out in left field from where they began. So what they find ends up being irrelevant and has no solid relationship to the initial conspiracy. I am watching the Lewis and Clark episode and whether or not Lewis committed suicide or not. In the end, there was no real information brought to the table that was not already said in the beginning.Much of the show is already set up, even before the so called investigations occur. There is no real inquiry, its just published information. As the case with Lewis, clearly the idea of whether he killed himself or not is not a new one as there are a bunch of books already published. In fact, they go and talk to an author and gets lots of \"yes's\".The show in general comes off as series of smoke and mirrors. Lots of flashy editing, zoom cuts, sound effects, and incidental music to create the effect. Brad chimes in saying nothing important, but usually either retelling what has happened, or foretelling what his \"experts\" will find out. So everything is already figured out.I watch the show out of curiosity and to see how many holes are in the episode. I really dont find him convincing or that the show brings out any secret history that might already be written elsewhere. I have never read his books and can see he has some reputation in the field.

It is dumpster diving for the age of economic default. As with most reality programming, there is a bit of contrivance to the set-up. A crew of easily definable characters is established that will be your guide for the nineteen episodes of Season One. With titles such as The Collector and The Gambler, the primary stars of \"Storage Wars\" are a quartet of entrepreneurs that go to auctions to purchase unclaimed and unpaid storage facilities. With five minutes to peruse the contents of a unit from afar (they aren't allowed into a space or to touch anything), they must decide whether or not to bid on the property. Using savvy or instinct, it's pay and play for our heroes--who sometimes score big rewards or major disappointment.While, to my mind, the concept alone doesn't necessarily scream entertainment--there is no denying the fascination in this culture of uncovering something for nothing. Of course, the idea is to claim a space for the lowest price possible, but bidders oftentimes drive the auction up on one another simply to deplete their cash supply. Every transaction is done with folding money only, so any apparent treasures tend to go to the fellow with the largest stack. This becomes evident early on when a unit of restaurant machinery sells for around $2700 and its obvious resale value would far exceed that. While glib and irresistible, the show spends little time exploring the darker aspect of its premise. Just what awful circumstance befell the unit renter that caused a default on a space with $20K worth of equipment? There is a sadder underbelly when you think too hard about it all.But let's not dwell. This is reality adventure and is certainly successful entertainment. The personalities involved are colorful and play for the camera. Everyone loves a gamble and so this can become an easy addiction. With an episode coming in just over 20 minutes, the show is fast paced, amusing, and has an almost instant payoff. Sometimes when they hit a big payday, I had to wonder \"why didn't I think of doing this?\" Other times, I just think \"who needs more junk in their lives.\" You can't help but play along. At one point, a half empty space looks worthless only to have a mini BMW in it. Anything is possible, and unraveling the mysteries is part of the show's excitement.

CROPSEY himself is part real, and part urban legend, in that the actual killer has become a larger than life bogeyman. Through interviews and archival news footage, the filmmakers present the facts, as well as some of the theories, like Satanism, that the public latched onto in order to make sense of the case. I first heard the name CROPSEY in the 1981 slasher film, THE BURNING, where CROPSEY was the vengeful caretaker, killing off those teens unlucky enough to stay at his summer camp. I don't know where the name originated, but I find the usage interesting. Highly recommended...", "term": "Legend vs. Reality...", "id": "7660:1_0"}, "7661:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "For the children of Staten Island, Cropsey was the bogeyman of their fears and nightmares, an escaped mental patient who supposedly lived in the tunnels beneath the ruins of the Willowbrook Mental Institution and periodically snatched children off the streets.  The stories differed in detail - some said he carried an axe or a long knife while others depicted him as having a hook for a hand - but there could be no doubt as to the fear he instilled in young minds.  Of course, children grow up and put away childish things, including any fear of what they eventually come to realize is just an urban legend.  Teenagers actually played around and tried to scare each other in the very woods where Cropsey supposedly hid.  Filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio were two such children who grew up hearing the legend of Cropsey.  As teenagers, they had assigned their local boogeyman to the rank of myth - but that changed in the summer of 1987 when young Jennifer Schweiger was kidnapped and murdered, her body turning up in the woods near Willowbrook.  A local derelict (and former orderly at Willowbrook) named Andre Rand was accused of the crime.  Suddenly, a number of older missing child cases were being reexamined in the light of the Schweiger tragedy, forcing Zeman, Brancaccio, and other Staten Island residents to wonder if the bogeyman of their childhoods was in fact real.And so it was that Zeman and Brancaccio returned to Staten Island to reexamine the Cropsey legend.  Once more, they walked the childhood paths into the abandoned grounds of the gigantic Willowbrook Mental Institution and other nearby locations where Andre Rand had been known to set up camp.  They spoke to the Schweigers and the families of local children who went missing and were never found, reexamining those cold cases with the help of former detectives who investigated those crimes; the indefatigable leader of Friends of Jennifer (whose members had diligently searched for and eventually found the body of Jennifer Schweiger - and who continue to search for the remains of the other missing children to this day); local historians; and journalists.  They also left no stone unturned in finding out more about suspected killer Andre Rand.  Naturally, this included an effort to secure a prison interview with the man - Rand refused, but the investigators were able to establish a correspondence relationship with him that provided some insight into the mind of this presumed killer (Rand has been convicted of kidnapping but not murder.)Is Cropsey as creepy a documentary as some have said?  I think there are several elements of creepiness to the entire presentation.  One, of course, comes in the form of the filmmakers' visits to Willowbrook and other abandoned environs in the area.  Willowbrook will forever be tainted by a heavy aura of hopelessness and tragedy.  As revealed by a young Geraldo Rivera in the early 1970s, the place was nothing but a dumping ground for unwanted, mentally handicapped kids who were barely cared for at all.  This lack of care plus the pure filthiness of the place was an affront to humanity itself.  You can't watch the filmmakers enter these grounds without thinking of the large number of children who once suffered there.  On a more visceral level, the filmmakers pick the darkness of night to enter one of the buildings seeking signs of possible devil worship or anything else of note they might find.  There is no way I would go there at night.  Of course, there is an overarching creepiness to the whole story because it involved the snatching and possible murders of young children, many of them disabled in some way.  In addition to that, the possibility of the bogeyman of your childhood actually having existed is a less than comforting thought.The filmmakers' investigation was suddenly energized all the more several months into the project when the local district attorney charged Rand with the 1981 kidnapping of Holly Ann Hughes.  Zeman and Brancaccio relate the new evidence and discuss the new witnesses who suddenly emerged to testify, including one woman who says she saw Rand kidnap her childhood friend Holly Ann in addition to a number of former alcoholics and drug addicts whose foggy memories at the time supposedly cleared up considerably, over two decades later, after they beat their bad habits.  Like the Schweiger trial, Rand was prosecuted purely on circumstantial evidence - and seemingly rather flimsy evidence at that, if you ask me.  Some express disappointment in this documentary's conclusion, but real human stories such as this aren't always tied up in a pretty little bow.  There is no closure for the families of the victims, and plenty of questions remain regarding Rand and any others possibly involved in the missing children cases.  Based solely on the facts revealed in this documentary, I could not say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Rand was guilty of any crime (I don't think he's innocent by any means; I'm just saying I would need more conclusive evidence before I could vote to convict him in a court of law).  He certainly looks the part of the crazy killer, and the filmmakers do in fact raise questions as to how people perceived Rand as seen through the prism of the media.  In the end, Cropsey isn't really about truth.  With all but one of the missing children's bodies undiscovered and Rand refusing to speak about the crimes, there is no great truth to be gleaned from this whole, sordid story.  The evil that men do will forever remain a mystery to most of us.  Still, it's a very human story that touches viewers on several emotional levels, feeding off of the fears we all share from our childhoods - and that makes it bloody fascinating, in my book.", "term": "What if the bogeyman of your childhood fears turned out to be real?", "id": "7661:1_0"}, "7662:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The movie is a documentary and not anything like a horror movie.

The film skates around some pretty seedy topics to identify the motives of the killer(s) that drift from the extremes of Satanic worship all the way to a much simpler - and very possible - euthanasia program of a madman.It's true that the film fails to deliver any concrete conclusion but that's almost the point. After years of searching for missing children, rumors circulating that charge individuals or groups of unspeakable acts, a police department that may be more bent on prosecuting someone rather than the right person, Cropsey paints a clouded picture that never promised to be simple.

On Staten Island, Cropsey took the form of a deranged mental patient who lived in the tunnel system beneath the abandoned Willowbrook State School and snatched children. It was an urban legend designed to keep children from playing in the dangerous ruins of the school, which had for decades housed mentally disabled children in such squalor that, in 1972, Geraldo Rivera made his name as an investigative reporter by taking cameras inside to film an expos&eacute; of the deplorable conditions. That led to its closure.In the 1970s and 1980s, there were a string of child disappearances on Staten Island. In 1987, Jennifer Schweiger, a 12-year-old girl with Downs syndrome, disappeared. Her body was found on the grounds of Willowbrook, and 43-year-old Andre Rand, a homeless man who had once worked as an orderly there, was charged with kidnapping Jennifer and presumed to be her murderer. He was convicted without any physical evidence linking him to the crime. An eccentric whom some painted as a manipulative demagogue to the homeless community at Willowbrook, perhaps mentally ill himself, Rand seemed to be Cropsey come to life. But was he guilty or just convenient? Did the legend of Cropsey play a role in how Rand was perceived by the public, the press, and by jurors?Andre Rand's questionable guilt might not distinguish the case if he had not been brought back to trial in 2004 for the kidnapping of another one of Staten Island's missing children, 7-year-old Holly Ann Hughes, who disappeared in 1981. This time, his guilt was established by a string of witnesses whose recollection of events surrounding the girl's disappearance had improved remarkably in 20 years. Andre Rand had become the community's scapegoat. But \"Cropsey\" is not an investigative documentary about a possible miscarriage of justice. In fact, it falls short in exploring the facts of the cases. It is an attempt to tie the folklore of a community to its reality: the legend of Cropsey come alive, the sins of the past come back to haunt Staten Island, parents desperately seeking closure.There is a lot of forced spookiness: Zeman and Brancaccio insist on exploring the ruins of Willowbrook at night, when they can't see anything. They speak to Rand's defense attorneys, to police officers who speak of Satanic Cults, to Rand's acquaintances, to journalists, to witnesses, to missing child activist Donna Cutugno in order to get a grasp of the case and the cultural issues that surround it. But \"Cropsey\" is unfocused in what it is trying to say. And, although the filmmakers get some good interviews, they often fail to ask the obvious questions or pursue obvious avenues of investigation. I was left not knowing what evidence was brought against Rand in the Schweiger trial. I don't even know the cause of death. If the police don't know it either, the filmmakers should have said. \"Cropsey\" explores an interesting subject but is simply not good enough to help me understand it.The DVD (Vicious Circle Films 2011): Bonus features are 11 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 min), 8 teaser trailers, and an audio commentary by Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio.

Had we ever actually gotten that movie, I think Cropsey would have been a much more satisfying thing than it is, though the story they cover--the real-life alleged serial killer Andre Rand who lies at the heart of the Cropsey urban legend--is interesting enough to carry the movie.Plot: co-directors Zeman and Brancaccio, both of whom grew up on Staten Island, had childhoods saturated in the urban legend of Cropsey, a shadowy, semi-legendary figure who supposedly lived in the bowels of the abandoned Willowbrook State School, a horrific mental institution that was the subject of an expose by Geraldo Rivera early in his career. Cropsey, it is said, was responsible for the disappearances of a number of area children over the years. The reality of the situation, at least as the State of New York would have us believe, is that Cropsey was actually Andre Rand, not a former patient there, but a former orderly. It has been proven that Rand did, in fact, live on the grounds of the former Willowbrook for a number of years in makeshift camps. Allegedly, he was also responsible for five of the disappearances attributed to Cropsey that took place between 1972 and 1987. The film, once it starts to focus on Rand, takes us through his arraignment and trial for the kidnapping of Holly Ann Hughes, who disappeared in 1981.For what it is, it's not bad. But what it is and what it purports to be are two different things, and that kept nagging at me as I watched the movie.

To my mind, \"Zombies: A Living History\" seemed the perfect show to bridge the gap. Tales of zombies and undead lore cross all international boundaries and are an inherent part of ancient history and cultural iconography. And as this documentary presentation begins, it does acknowledge the various interpretations of the zombie legend across the globe. From Scandinavia, to Asia, to Africa--the show introduces a number of the prominent historical references (Draugr, Golem, Jiang Shi, Ghoul, Hoodoo, and even Frankenstein get a mention among other quick topics). But each of these subjects is brief, at best, and it soon becomes clear that the purpose of this production really isn't traditional history at all and the subtitle of \"A Living History\" becomes more focused. The program's fundamental positioning seems to take off with the Romero film \"Night of the Living Dead\" amidst an era of Cold War paranoia and how this catapulted the zombie menace into a new age.As for the experts on this piece of analysis, you do get a couple of scientists and even an archeologist--but the primary experts are popular authors of horror fiction. Max Brooks (the sublime World War Z) and Jonathan Maberry (Bram Stoker Award Winner) are primary contributors as well as a source from Fangoria Magazine (as well as other known writers). The general material relates how the popularization of zombies has been in direct relationship to our fears and paranoia through time. Zombies actually represent crisis events that are so horrific that they strike at our basest fears. Cannibalism, the plague aspect, the horde mentality, and manmade science gone awry are all hot button fears that get encompassed into undead mythology. It is, in truth, a fascinating correlation and one with substantial merit. Even the recent phenomenon of zombie plague preparedness (the CDC actually issued a report on the subject earlier this year) is just a tool utilized to advance disaster protocol in an engaging way.This being the new breed of History Channel documentary, we are treated throughout to both clips from the aforementioned \"Night of the Living Dead\" as well as some gruesome original recreations. It is the ultimate in infotainment. There are fun bits (such as demonstrations of which weapons to choose to battle a zombie), that further push the boundaries of documentary filmmaking. But it is all quite engaging. In the end, the program makes some valid correlations about the context of zombies in pop culture and real world concerns. Of course, when discussing movie monsters--the topic has a huge aspect of fictionalization and speculation that might not sit well with purists. But as a hybrid docu-feature, \"A Living History\" is pretty successful at meeting its own goals. Fun for zombie enthusiasts, but also has some interesting content for those that don't get the appeal.

Maybe.In the winter of 1892 lived an unconventional young woman named Clara who was at times referred to as Miss Montague (never mind that it's not her real name). Clara possessed a sharp wit and a quicksilver tongue and an unbounded curiosity. One day, as Christmas loomed, she ventured outside the tavern in which she toiled as a barmaid and observed a mysterious snowman and engaged a passing pedestrian in a brief but intriguing dialogue. And when the gentleman had walked on, Clara at times Miss Montague, who was a friend to whimsy and no stranger to impulse, decided the conversation wasn't yet over. And that was Clara's first brush with the Doctor. Sort of.In Matt Smith's oeuvre of Doctor Who holiday programming, \"The Snowmen\" challenges \"A Christmas Carol\" for top honors, it's that brilliant. As we near the Doctor's 50th anniversary, expect even more nods to classic Doctor Who, and why not start with this special? \"The Snowmen\" finds a gutted Doctor wandering the streets of Victorian London. Much time has elapsed, and yet he still mourns the loss of the Ponds, to the extent that he's disengaged from the world, retired from saving it. And then in steps a clever, cheeky tavern wench (Jenna-Louise Coleman) who occasionally poses as a prim and proper governess (or is it the other way around). She may be the only person to wrench the Doctor from his mopey doldrums, just in time to save the planet from a horde of ravenous alien snowmen, and on Christmas eve.The Doctor nowadays prefers his solitude and his wallowing in self-pity, but he's got staunch friends and allies. Delightfully, Steven Moffat dips into the \"A Good Man Goes to War\" episode and brings back part of the Doctor's army: the Great Detective herself, Madame Vastra (famous in this period for inspiring the creation of Sherlock Holmes), her faithful assistant/wife Jenny Flint, and the perplexingly alive (and wonderfully comic) Sontaran Strax. In Victorian England, this concerned trio keep tabs on the morose Doctor. I wouldn't at all mind a spin-off about them, they're a freakin' awesome ensemble. If you get a chance, check out mini-episode \"The Great Detective,\" which prequels \"The Snowmen.\"Richard E. Grant plays the icy Dr. Simeon, him what as a child became lackey to this episode's big bad, a classic adversary (voiced by Ian McKellen) whom the Doctor hadn't faced since his second incarnation back in the 1960s. Speaking of, maybe you'd noticed that Matt Smith early on seems to be channeling David Troughton, the second Doctor, even up to his wardrobe. Recall that Troughton first foiled this enemy in 1967 in \"The Abominable Snowmen\" (in a remote Himalayan monastery) and the year after that in \"The Web of Fear\" (in the London Underground). I love the callbacks.Matt SMith is fantastic again. In the ep's first half, he exudes devastating grief and gives off that thousand year stare. I felt like cheering when he finally does shake off his apathy, discards the Troughton duds, and puts on the bow tie. Bow ties are cool. Jenna-Louise Coleman dazzles from jump. She has instant chemistry with Matt Smith and even threatens to outtalk him. I like that her Clara isn't at all intimidated by the Doctor and seems smart enough and gutsy enough to keep up. I love that Clara is tested several times, once by Madame Vastra and later by the Doctor. She passes both with flying colors. Much like Series 5 explored the mystery of Amelia Pond and that crack on the wall, Series 7 looks to center itself around the mystery surrounding Clara. And there is a huuuuuge mystery surrounding Clara.\"The Snowmen\" is an instant classic and worth repeated viewings for its entertainment value and for the sheer fun of trying to nudge out all possible clues Moffat had layed in. There's sorrow in this narrative, but great humor as well. And the steadfastness of the Doctor's friends. And Coleman's spark and show of promise. And those callbacks to musty old episodes. And, of course, the continuing excellence of Matt Smith. Line by line, this may be the most quotable episode ever.Strax forever!

And each Doctor brings his own spin to the holiday themed episodes. Last year Matt Smith's Doctor took on Dickens in an outer-space interpretation of \"A Christmas Carol.\" It was frenetic and funny, managed to seamlessly blend tragedy with humor, and was emotionally satisfying without being cloying. This year, we had \"The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe\" (its central plot point borrows from a certain literature classic--I think you can figure out which one). This may well be the most straightforward and heartfelt Christmas special yet. Set in World War II era Britain, Smith helps a family adjusts to what promises to be a painful season by making a perfect getaway experience for the kids. However, with the best of intentions, one of the Doctor's surprises leads to unexpected dangers. The family must work together to ensure their very survival and get back home.The special capitalizes of an eco-friendly theme as the principle aliens within the piece are not your typical beasts. They too are a race battling to live as manmade intrusions into their environment threaten their existence and livelihood. Might the Doctor and his charges be of assistance? It is Christmas after all. Or as certain annihilation looms, might it be too late for anyone to survive? This is Doctor Who after all. The show's pacing is brisk and its storyline affirms a strong message of loyalty and family. In fact, the Doctor's exposure to the widow and her children make him contemplate those that he has left behind through the course of his exploits.While many of the past Christmas specials were completely independent, \"The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe\" actually fits comfortably into the timeline of the on-going series. With a minimum of screen time, the show's finale packs an emotional punch that really resonates and sets up future episodes. And while, in truth, the main story was pleasant enough--it is these last few minutes that really distinguish this special and make it memorable. Smith is crisp and amusing as always, but it is Claire Skinner (as the mother) that really gets some nice dramatic moments. All in all, this is a very well balanced presentation. And, especially due to the last few moments, it is one that I will remember. A solid 4 star episodes with a simple but effective 5 star finale, I'd rank this as one of the sweetest (and possibly best) Christmas specials yet.

I watched it. I'll try almost anything once.Once is too much.The story is about a good cop who gets framed by the evil owner of a gigantic corporation/crime syndicate. Since he is assumed to be dead, he cannot go back to his wife or son - though, in a maudlin moment, he visits the boy while the boy is sleeping. There should have been a puppy and some kittens.At the burial service for him, the cop watches from behind a tree, about as difficult to spot as the Washington Monument in DC. Somehow, though, all the police, whom one assumes to be alert and vigilant, miss his presence.Anyway, somehow, and I really do not understand how or why, he gets involved with a circus that seems to have about six members. They seem to perform before a similar number of people. Sets are not a strong point. He performs by battling a small person (ok - dwarf) of extraordinary fighting ability and numerous tattoos.The circus is run by a large black guy whose overacting is great enough to be the converse of Keanu Reeves, if Reeves were actually trying to act. The black guy is a master magician, and he trains the ex-cop to use a cape formerly used by a now departed magician - the magic is fake, but it is allowed to seem almost real to the audience in the course of the episode. Since he used to read a comic called \"The Cape\" to his son to put him to sleep, the ex-cop assumes the identity of \"The Cape.\" This might put you to sleep.The bad guy has a British accent and occasional not human eyes, and he has been committing crimes in costume, even though he is the head of a huge conglomerate. For sheer fun, one presumes. These are the crimes pinned on the ex-cop. They are designed to force \"the city\" to privatize its police force by turning it over to his corporation, which the city promptly does. Global domination to follow.The circus members are either committed to destroying the bad guy or become immediately so dedicated, and the Cape and they rob banks belonging to the corporation.The evil overlord's head henchman turns out to be the Cape's former best friend and police partner, who framed him because Mr. Evil threatened to harm his family. He is, however, not a happy henchman. In these sorts of bad movies/shows, having a family is a definite no-no.I don't know who any of the actors were, but none of them were very good, except for the little person who has some comic flair.The show is half serious and half camp/cartoon and occasionally funny.

What do they call you?\"- Vince Faraday: \"The Cape.\"- Clerk: \"The Cape?\" (pauses) \"Well, you'll work on it.\"After the ultimately disappointing HEROES bit NBC in the tuchus, the peacock network gets back in the saddle with THE CAPE, yet another superhero franchise. It's an old trope that fuels this series: a righteous man drawing a line in the sand, making a stand in a corrupt town. As Palm City festers, we run into Vince Faraday (David Lyons), dedicated police sergeant who loves his family, especially his young boy. When Faraday is framed and presumed dead, he's instead taken in by the Carnival of Crime and learns some very interesting skills. Out for a reckoning, Faraday assumes the identity of his son's favorite comic book character, the Cape. And off he goes, rarin' to clean up the town. But, nah, he's not ready. Meanwhile, power-mad billionaire Peter Fleming - a.k.a. the crime lord Chess - launches the world's inaugural private metropolitan police force, thus strengthening Chess's stranglehold on Palm City.In watching the pilot, we're instantly aware of the tone, which is dark and oppressive and very serious. Thankfully, Keith David's presence - as the bombastic showman Max Malini who becomes Vince's instructor - lightens the mood some, and Vince himself is a bit of a wiseacre. The circus community inhabiting Max Malini's Show of Fantastic Oddities and Amazements - and, interestingly, these carnies are also professional bank robbers - goes a long way into keeping me invested in the series because, frankly, Vince's story arc projects down a tired, beaten path. His relationship with his son is so earnestly executed it's hard to muffle all bouts of yawns and eye-rollings.Costumes and gangster freaks people the screen, lending the show a heightened and stylized look. In the first two episodes, we meet Chess who isn't shy about sporting a mask and has those glowing reptilian peepers. A smuggler henchman called Scales appropriately features scaly skin. We soon glom onto a secret society of assassins calling itself Tarot, a French member of which has soon poisoned the Cape. At this stage Vince's rogues gallery looks pretty promising.The superhero elements stay within the frame of reality. No aliens from blown up planets and no magic words. Instead, we get sleight-of-hand and hi-tech gadgets and circus props and loads and loads of training. THE CAPE owes more to Batman or Mantis than to Superman or Shazam. I like the hook, that thing which distinguishes the Cape from other crimefighters. It's as if Houdini had become a superhero. It's neat that Vince Faraday gets mentored by circus freaks in the ways of martial arts, mentalism, and illusion casting. Max Malini promises Vince: \"There are 37 vanishing illusions that use a cape. You will master them all.\" And so he does. The Cape gains an ally in Orwell, once the sole blogger in the wilderness exposing Palm City's shady elements, but now providing the Cape with research and tech support. Sexy sci-fi icon Summer Glau plays the mysterious Orwell, but I can't help but note that Glau seems to specialize in abruptly-axed television shows. So I'm hoping this is where the trend breaks.There are passages which are heavy-handed and drag a bit. The characters could've also used more development. But then we get to sequences which are gratifyingly action-packed - Vince can do crazy things with his cape - and I like that Vince isn't perfect on his first time out in costume. Obviously, the Cape's showmanship is key to how successful this show is gonna be. But, for me, the best moments revolve around the circus. That's when the show is at its funniest and most interesting. Anyway, as his wife and child mourn the dearly departed Vince Faraday, will the world come to view the Cape favorably? More importantly, will the Nielsen ratings? I'm on board for now. But I said the same thing when HEROES was starting out. 3.5 out of 5 stars for THE CAPE so far, one of the stars thrown in based purely on potential.", "term": "\"One man can't make a difference with a tag on his toe.\"", "id": "7762:1_0"}, "7763:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "TV shows always seem to be an all or nothing proposition in Amazon reviews. If someone watches a show, they automatically feel that it is five star quality despite its limitations. If someone tries a show and doesn't like it, they generally relegate it to a one star status despite its good points. Don't believe it? Go to the reviews of any program you absolutely hate and look at the glowing five star reviews from its fans. In truth, most shows fall somewhere in between--not every show you watch should automatically be considered as great entertainment and not every show you dislike merits a dismissive one star. I bring this up with NBC's short lived \"The Cape\" for one reason--I have only heard the show described as terrific or as terrible with very little middle ground. Personally, I think the show is neither terrific nor terrible but falls into the TV netherworld of a show with potential that never really fulfilled its promise.Capitalizing on the notion that every story with comic book origins deserves a Hollywood treatment (in itself, a specious idea), \"The Cape\" was introduced to capture the audience left when the increasingly problematic \"Heroes\" left the air. But lacking that show's complex mythology and appealing cast, it was an uphill battle from the start. I do contend that the elements to have developed a successful show were all present, they were just never assembled in the right way.The Good: David Lyons was a likable lead--a family man and cop who is forced into a heroic alter ego when framed (and seemingly murdered) by the town's super villain. James Frain has a nice menace as the unstable foe. Morally corrupt Keith David and a bevy of carnival performers provide unlikely support to our new hero. And sci-fi stalwart Summer Glau is on hand as the altruistic, and completely underdeveloped, Orwell. And best of all--Vinnie Jones!The Bad: The show never loses interest in Lyons' wife and child. And, I'm sorry, they just aren't compelling characters. The show's momentum grinds to an absolute halt every time they appear. Excruciating.The Frustrating: I don't think the show ever determined what it wanted to do and is tonally all over the place. Veering from maudlin to comedic from one moment to the next does little to shore up the inconsistencies in the show. Frain, Glau, and David all have great potential--but none are given fully developed plot lines. There is simultaneously too much going on and not enough--there needed to be more focus on the elements that worked. There needed to be more emphasis on the bigger good versus evil concept as opposed to lesser stand alone episodes.With so many choices in this overcrowded genre, I don't know that \"The Cape\" rates particularly highly. But it is far from unwatchable and its cast is game. A show I wanted to like more than I did, it still boasts nice production values and a laugh or two--but never gelled to one cohesive vision.

Far from being a quiet little hamlet, this little town hums with activity and village gossips, especially a Miss Pole [Imelda Staunton]who flits around from one hearsay to another, avidly passing on any little nuggets of gossip to the other inhabitants.Cranford is set aflutter by the arrival of a new doctor, Dr Harrison [Simon Woods] who is young, handsome, single and very much into trying new methods of treatment, to the initial consternation of the townspeople. Dr Harrison finds himself attracted to a beautiful local lass, Sophy [Kimberly Nixon] though he inadvertently attracts the romantic affections of other single women in Cranford. But the story does not merely focus on romance, as there are other more serious themes underlying the series. For one, there is talk of a railroad being built that would go through Cranford, and disrupt the idyllic life in the village, giving rise to the inevitable battle between modernization and the desire for things to remain unchanged. The local rich lady, Lady Ludlow portrayed by Francesca Annis is very much opposed to change, and not only opposes the railroad but also any form of societal change, such as literacy amongst the lower classes [she refuses to hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].There is also the theme of lost love, death and grief. Miss Matty Jenkins[ Judi Dench] finds herself recounting the tale of her lost love [played by Michael Gambon]. This is what makes Cranford such an engaging viewing experience - the absurd [the story of the cat swallowing an antique lace and how the lace is retrieved] is interlaced with tales of poignancy and everything unfolds leisurely. It is a tale that we wish will never end, and hope to revisit again and again.", "term": "Beautifully-filmed British period drama", "id": "7847:1_0"}, "7848:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "I really enjoyed the story but could not get past these characters continually smoking around a seriously asthmatic child.

It's clear from the opening moments how romance between the characters will work out and Strangers does nothing to make me question my notions of these films. It's not a bad movie by any means; the performances are strong and the story makes sense, but there's no drama here because everything they do has been played out by every other film that uses this cross-cultural matchup. Granted, it's rife with political baggage, but it seems like these films are afraid to actually approach the politics. Guy Nattiv and Erez Tadmor, the writer/director combo of Strangers, appear to try to breach those boundaries by using the Israeli attack on Lebanon, but it winds up only being used as a roadblock to their romance instead of the drama it might have had. Eventually, these films all feel like Romeo and Juliet knockoffs played during modern times, pushing aside any actual relevance for the rote progression of a romance film.Still, Strangers is a decent filmed, well made and solidly acted. Even if there's no question as to how the relationship will work out, the performances from Levo and Azabal are strong. They have good chemistry together and it's easy to root for their success, though there's no suspense in the drama to make you wonder. The story is well-filmed and there are some interesting soccer sequences that try to parallel the political struggles going on outside of Berlin, which the lovers see and deal with together, but none of it ever gels into anything substantial or all that interesting.Strangers comes to us from Zeitgeist Films in a very standard package. The anamorphic image is nothing spectacular, but is an adequate image with good detail and colors. The sound is a standard stereo mix with nothing to laud, but nothing to complain about, either. The only extra is a trailer.Strangers is a frustrating film. There's much about it that could have been great, and the setting could have made the politics behind the romance both muted by the distance from the action and more explosive for the same reason. Unfortunately, Nattiv and Tadmor cut the corners on all counts, using the national conflicts to force some personal conflict, but betraying themselves by allowing it to all be okay with a smile. In the end, it's cheap romance that, while competent in all facets, is a film I have a hard time recommending.-Full review at dvdverdict.com", "term": "None of it ever gels into anything substantial", "id": "7850:1_0"}, "7851:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "A love affair between an Israeli man and Palestinian woman is obviously going to run into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

I say \"like all the best\", because that's the format that's always seemed best able to bring out the more adult side of the superhero genre.

Yes, it's catered for the tweeners. It is cheesy, and the characters are schoolyard roster caricatures, and the occult portions come off fairly subdued. But dang if it weren't a constant source of guilty pleasure for me. Yeah, I gobbled the show up.Somewhere in the United Kingdom is the House of Anubis, stately old dormitory nestled on the grounds of a prestigious boarding school. To this dormitory approaches upbeat American teenager Nina Martin (Nathalia Ramos). She's tsk-tsked for showing up two weeks late, but what's one to do when the scholarship is derailed by red tape? Nina harbors hopes of making friends fast, but there go them hopes when her arrival coincides with the mysterious departure of one of the students, Joy (Klariza Clayton). When Joy's best mate, Patricia (Jade Ramsey), is unable to contact her, she suspects Nina of having something to do with the disappearance and begins to make her life miserable. It's a crap welcome for Nina. It doesn't help that the school staff seem to be going out of their way to eradicate all signs that Joy was ever there.Luckily, Nina strikes up friendships with other schoolmates - the level-headed Fabian (Brad Kavanagh) and the flighty but amiable Amber (Ana Mulvoy Ten). And when the whodunit elements begin to mount up, these three found the Sibuna club (And \"Sibuna\" backwards is what?). So why are the attic and the cellar strictly off limits to the students? What are these cryptic clues Nina keeps stumbling over? And what sort of no good shenanigans is Victor Rodenmaar (Francis Magee) up to, him who's the very dodgy dormitory caretaker and who looks like Luke Perry's creepy old uncle? Good thing that, to quote a Sibuna member, \"Nina is super-sleuthy.\" Maybe she can figure out why certain suspicious so-and-so's are trying to \"tip the scales of life.\"There's an amusing exchange between two faculty members that somehow solidified my liking for this show: In the scene Victor is complaining about the meddling students in his cranky care, calling them \"nauseating, arrogant, interfering children,\" at which point one of the other teachers wrily observes: \"Do you sometimes think you might be in the wrong job, Victor?\" Heh.To offset all the skullduggery the show also tracks the antics of other kids in Anubis House not involved in the ongoing mystery. But, honestly, I could've done without pranksters Jerome and Alfie whose infantile goings-on were mostly lame and insensitive. Made it hard for me to like them. Mara (Tasie Dhanraj), on the other hand, is perfectly lovely. She's smart and really sweet and so unassuming. I'm a bit baffled that she wasn't part of the inner clique. I think Mara is wasted with the silly sideplots - mostly involving her crush on the house jock - that she gets swept into. But probably the tweener girls will swoon over the oodles of pining and self-sacrificing done by Mara. The adorable Tasie Dhanraj makes it all palatable.If you're raring for secret societies and cryptic clues and hidden passages and panels and mystical artifacts... If you're hankering for Goosebumps-style thrills and a smidge of ancient Egyptian history... If you're entertained by campy yet high stakes cat-and-mouse games played out between the pupils and the secretive school faculty, well, House of Anubis delivers on all fronts. And if you're a parent or a guardian and you're looking for some harmless fun for your kids to watch, House of Anubis does offer good lessons in teamwork and perseverance and thinking outside the box. Adversely, the kids in the show do tend to routinely sneak out past their curfew. They do thumb their noses at the authority of certain adult figures, never mind that these adults seem UP TO NO GOOD.

Extremely well written, the series has a serial format, where a typical episode runs about 11 minutes, and ends in some kind of cliffhanger or crisis.  Featuring some enjoyable characters, interesting locations, numerous mysteries, and some spooky situations, this is a fun and entertaining series with great appeal to children and young adults, that can also be appreciated by adults.The complex storyline has several long arcs which involves the disappearance of one of the students, and the investigation of certain mysteries.  Events in the past have aligned to create a crisis situation, as supernatural elements also come into play.  The characters are defined, but continue to evolve and change, as the plot twists and turns on its long journey to a resolution.  Some events you can see coming, while others are quite unexpected, making for an adventure that is well rounded and satisfying, as nearly everything takes place on the school's grounds.New arrival from America Nina Martin (Mathalia Ramos) is assigned to live in Anubis House, a coeducational facility where Victor Rodenmarr (Francis Magee) is the live in administrator, and Trudy (Mina Anwar) is the housekeeper. As part of an initiation test, Nina sneaks into the attic, where she discovers a strange object that turns out to be a clue to mysterious events that occurred in the house long ago.A related storyline concerns Patricia (Jade Ramsey), who is extremely upset that her best friend Joy (Klariza Clayton) has disappeared, and that she has been largely unsuccessful in getting answers from the school's administration.  Pat is approached by a strange man named Rufus Zeno (Roger Barclay), who eventually becomes a major player in the expanding drama, which also includes teachers and members of the administration.As Nina develops a relationship with Sara Frobisher-Smythe (Rita Davies), an old woman named who once lived in Anubis House, Nina soon becomes the key figure and driving force in the expanding and encompassing drama.  She forms a secret alliance called \"Sibuna\" (\"Anubis\" spelled backwards) with Fabian (Brad Kavanagh), Amber (Ana Mulvoy Ten) and some other residents in the house, who are dedicated to investigating the mystery.  When Joy's disappearance ties into Sibuna's activities, Pat also joins the group.Not everything is devoted to Scooby Doo sleuthing, as with teens involved, much time is devoted to normal adolescent concerns like schoolwork, dealing with teachers, and kids learning about love.  Students Mara (Tasie Lawrence) and Mick (Bobby Lockwood), who eventually become a couple, are just ordinary kids, and are among those who provide some respite from all the intrigue.Many times the cliffhanger format makes the action seem forced, but together with the various plot twists and conspiracies, it generally makes for a very lively and spirited adventure.  Ultimately, House of Anubis a rousing success, because at its conclusion, the various threads of the narrative come together nicely, incorporating a strong supernatural component.  The adventure ends on a high note, with the relationships of the key characters taking new paths that should please most viewers.The talented cast really bring the characters to life, and allow House of Anubis to achieve its full potential.  The actors are engaging, charming, and mostly convincing, in a young adult drama that has enough mystery and drama, to appeal to some adults as well.The Region 2 release is a PG rated four disc set, which contains the entire first season, which is divided into two parts, the House of Secrets (317 minutes), and the House of Codes (345 minutes).  Bonus features are a little light, with a couple of behind the scenes featurettes.  For those with region free players, buying this set from Amazon UK could be a less costly option than buying it at Amazon USA or watching the episodes on demand.

Leguizano is always good for a film of this nature and I was hoping for more of his bleak style.A film that provokes thought and squashes traditional cinimatic ideas is how I'd catagorize it.The blu ray is as sharp as can be and really holds up in the appropriately dark scenes (with the right tv). I was gravely disappointed in the \"alternate ending(s)\" which are only on the blu ray version. This is the kind of film that could have had a field day with ending possibilities but totally blew it. I actually bought the blu ray to delve into the \"endings\" but got alot of \"alternate angles\" instead.Far from being my favorite silver-screen prognosticator of doom, it holds it's own with  uniqueness, and a hard independent quality.

Anderson's work on &lt;em>Fringe&lt;/em> over the past three seasons has been consistently top-notch. And then there is &lt;em>Vanishing on 7th Street&lt;/em>, and I have absolutely no idea how I feel about this movie, honestly. I'm more conflicted about this than I have been about any movie I've reviewed this year. On one hand, it has so many of the qualities that make me love Brad Anderson movies. On the other hand, it's a feature-length &lt;em>Fringe&lt;/em> episode.The plot: Luke (Hayden Christensen), a news anchor, wakes up one morning and finds everyone... gone. Well, pretty much everyone. Paul (John Leguizamo), on the other hand, is awake when it happens--he's a movie theater projectionist, and while he's not looking when it happens, he hears it all too well. We see their stories in parallel over the next few days as they wander the city trying to figure out where everyone went. Eventually, they run into Rosemary (Thandie Newton), a bar owner lucky enough to have a generator to keep the lights on, and James (Jacob Latimore in his first feature role), a smartass teenager, and the four of them unite against the forces of darkness. Literally. Oh, yeah, and there's a creepy little girl (&lt;em>Flipped&lt;/em>'s Taylor Groothuis) running around for no apparent reason.And that last sentence pretty much sums up everything that drove me nuts about this movie. In &lt;em>El Maquinista&lt;/em>, nothing made sense. Absolutely nothing. But you knew that eventually we'd get enough pieces of the puzzle to put it all together (and we did, though in the most ambivalent Big Reveal ever, which I thought was one of the strongest sequences in the movie). And you come into a Brad Anderson movie expecting that, eventually, we will get all those pieces. Here... and maybe this a spoiler, sorry if so... we never do. Nothing is ever explained. Sometimes, that can be a really good thing. Other times, not so much. I haven't quite figured out what the dividing line is yet, but I can tell you that in this case, \"not so much\" applies. You get to the final scene and I can't tell you why it's so infuriating without spoilers, but come on, now, you can't just &lt;em>leave&lt;/em> it like that if you don't have a whole season of Anna Torv looking for clues. But that's exactly what he does.Putting aside the major plot and thematic problems, it's not an awful movie given its framework. John Leguizamo is usually fun to watch, and this is one of his best performances since &lt;em>To Wong Foo&lt;/em>, while Thandie Newton's character is forceful and capable and exactly the person you'd want at your back in a firefight.

It leaves a more haunting, memorable trail than most movies in the genre. But in between its first and its lasting impressions, it somewhat loses its way in the dark.Too much goes unexplained. For example, we see John Leguizamo stranded in his darkened movie theater one minute - then we next see him lying battered and bruised in an illuminated bus stop shelter. What happened to get him there? In his commentary, Director Anderson says that there was some scripting that would have explained Leguizamo's trajectory, but a variety of constraints prevented this explanation from becoming part of the film. Actually, Anderson thought this was all to the good though - that some things were best left to the imagination. I'm not so sure about that. It seems Leguizamo's navigation of the engulfing, vanquishing night would have been one of the processes most interesting to watch. Without showing such process, the film too often ends up being just abrupt, choppy, and undeveloped.It also has too many lapses of logic. The creeping darkness doesn't play fair. It shifts its rules of engagement, overwhelming one person, while allowing another similarly situated person to survive, at least for a while. Well, that could be an additional aspect of the evil of the darkness. It toys randomly with its victims, like a cat may or may not toy with a mouse, sheerly on a whim.Then I had one of my common technical complaints about this film. The DVD often projected as an indecipherable smudge on my TV screen. So it ran as murky rather than sinisterly dark. There is something about the final lighting/filtering process that many modern filmmakers use that causes their movies to be a chore to watch on home TV's. I wish filmmakers would get back to whatever technology was used from the 1920's through the 1960's that allows their films to play as appropriately shaded rather than just obscure when run on a TV screen.The Director's commentary doesn't add a lot to a viewer's appreciation of the film. Brad Anderson starts out sounding too much like Ben Stein, making a dreary, nasal drone of his narrative. So unless you have a lot of spare time, you can probably skip the commentary and most of the other extras, except for the interviews.However the Director's commentary does highlight at least one telling aspect of this film and its making. Anderson talks about how apt it was to settle on Detroit as a location for the action. The City itself is perhaps the most fascinating character in the entire movie. It becomes an icon of our crumbling economy, our crumbling culture. Some of the scenes in the movie call for shots of major urban intersections shown desolate, abandoned, post-apocalyptic.

Unfortunately, the special features are some of the worst inclusions I have seen on a film like this, and the only thing giving this some higher marks was the 7.1 DTS.The story follows four people wallowing through their idiocies in trying to survive some unknown catastrophe that leaves a city (played by Detroit - which was a better character than everyone here) devoid of people. Some bad CGI shadows follow them around trying to gobble them up sans their clothing.

They are no different except for one alternate camera angle and a different sunset - nothing changes from the film.* Revealing 7th Street (making of), 7:04 minutes. Talking heads & really bad insight by the cast on the film and story.* Creating the Mood of 7th, 7:04 minutes. They essentially took the cuts from the first one and made this longer one, but with reasons for why they chose Detroit. Which I have to say I am not sure if all of the reasoning made Detroit seem worse (\"gothic\", \"Dead\" etc.), or they just didn't realize they were saying it.* Behind the scenes montage, 2:11 minutes. Several identical cuts from the other two quips, with no dialogue. Would be best as a workbook for the staff of the film, otherwise a complete skipper.* HDNet Promo, 4:19 minutes (In HD). The standard trailer length plug.* Fangoria Interviews, 2 @ 31 minutes. This was actually an insightful and thorough interview process and was better than the commentary. Thankfully, Brad takes up 22 minutes of the set and will be worth the watch for his fans. Jacob's lasts only a few minutes and the rest is clips of the film.* Dig Copy, not disc dependent.* Commentary, see Fangoria interview instead.I was not impressed with the film, the bad effects that shined through on BD, or the ending being given away on the cover art (so no surprise for me, that ending sucked anyway) but I was impressed with the 7.1 - maybe only getting used by the creature sounds at various times, but a nice immersion.

A lot of things went wrong and made this awful.You start with people going away in a weird way and people asking why. The main actors hang in there through this, and it all seems good. Then you have some of the scenes that try to keep people out of the shadows, some that made it seem as though the world is really hard to understand, and even when the vanishings start to make sense it hurts to watch it progress. The writers are at fault in a lot of this, and the direction hurts as well. What you have is an \" o no, avoid that shadow\" story mingling with a really boring output from the actors. Overacting is a theme as well as trying to make you scared of the nothing that is really not menacing, and it gets old fast.

Paul (understated and effective John Leguizamo) is a projectionist working at a packed Detroit theater. Then, suddenly the light fails. The next moment Paul finds himself alone (well, almost) in the silent theater - everyone is gone, perhaps everyone in the entire city. The fact is, Paul - and a news reporter Luke (Hayden Christensen), a therapist Rosemary (Thandie Newton) and a young boy named James (Jacob Latimore) - are among the \"survivors\" of the mysterious blackout.In this kind of suspense (like \"The Birds\") you don't have to explain everything, as long as you can keep the viewers interested in what is going on. Unfortunately this does not happen in \"Vanishing on 7th Street.\" Information is given bit by bit - long nights, a man in Chicago, the Roanoke Colony, and most importantly, rules for survival - but they add up to nothing. Characters attempt to theorize about the meaning of total \"wipeout,\" but what they talk about is just dull. Some ideas are directly borrowed from other apocalyptic horror movies.
