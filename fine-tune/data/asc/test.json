In doing so it develops enough that it held my interest through the first two seasons.  Since SyFy only makes 13 episode seasons character development is something that has to occur as the story develops because there aren't enough episodes to give us any background and so it is written into episodes as flashbacks and fragmented memories of the past, and the present as the past intersects with the present.  I'm watching the third season now, so the show has held my attention through not with the enthusiasm of most SyFy shows I like.

It's the description of \"Being Human,\" a bittersweet little drama about a little supernatural gang trying to live their lives in an mundane world. It starts off similar to the original BBC series, but soon branches off in its own dark direction.Vampire Aidan (Sam Witwer) and his werewolf buddy Josh (Sam Huntington) move into a nice rented house in Boston. But they find themselves with a third roommate -- a ghost named Sally (Meaghan Rath) who was engaged to their landlord until she died. George and Mitchell work a pair of low-level hospital jobs, and attempt to do normal things like date, join the neighborhood watch, and pal around with kids.However, the trio still have supernatural problems. Josh struggles to reunite with his family despite his lycanthropy, and has a relationship go very awry. As Sally struggles to deal with being dead, she discovers that her fiancee did something unspeakable to her. And Aidan's life is disrupted by the city's overlord, Bishop (Mark Pellegrino), who is planning something major for the vampire population -- and will allow no one to stand in his way.The obvious question about \"Being Human\" is: how does it stack up beside the original BBC version? Well, it sticks pretty closely to the BBC series' storylines for the first few episodes, but with more episodes to flesh things out in, it branches out in some new directions, with some new characters and events introduced to the story (such as a little boy whose friendship with Aidan ends in tragedy).And this series maintains much of the flavor of the original series: clever comedy based on the idea of three supernaturals living \"normal\" lives (Aidan vamps out during a family dinner) and personal drama, while also delving into the painful issues of temptation, loss, and what it means to be human. The entire season is cloaked in bittersweet reflection, especially since the characters' attempts to be \"normal\" keep tripping up.As for the actors, they're all pretty solid. Witwer is all gothic dimply charm, and he wrenches your heart during some of Aidan's sadder moments; Huntington's Josh is an endearingly earnest nerd, but he does get a bit whiny sometimes; and Rath's Sally is pretty, flaky and has some issues with her relationships.

I take great pleasure in watching the horrifically poor monster movies that they produce, as well as shows like \"Eureka\", which is one of my all time favorites. I mention this only because when I started watching \"Being Human\" on Netflix, I was confused. The production values were so high, I thought I must have been mistaken about it being a SyFy show. I googled it, and sure enough... it was produced for SyFy, but it seems like it was made for one of the major networks, such care was taken in its manufacture. In no way do I mean this as a slight against SyFy's other, much cheesier productions.At first, I had somewhat mixed feelings about \"Being Human\". The vampire character, Aidan, came off as being terribly cliched and boring. I couldn't believe that yet another story was going to include the stereotypical vampire: pale, dark haired, handsome, moody, full of angst, etc. Likewise, the ghost character, Sally, seemed like a spoiled brat with the sole purpose of whining at every possible opportunity. Yet... I kept watching. Part of the reason for my perseverance was that the story seemed to have great potential (which proved true), and another big reason was that the werewolf character, Josh, was incredibly endearing. His goofy, awkward waddling through life made up for the pissing and moaning of his two roommates.Fortunately, as the season progressed, I grew to have great empathy for all three of these characters. Miraculously, Aidan was salvaged and became somebody that I both admired and empathized with, which is definitely a first in my book, as far as moody, privileged vampires go. I also grew to care for Sally, and empathized with her plight as a spirit caught between worlds, struggling for peace and retribution. Josh continued to appeal to me, and my initial fondness for his character only grew.What is perhaps even more remarkable, on the subject of characters, is how well the lesser ones are developed and brought to life. Bishop, the primary villain, is a monster that truly radiates charisma. Despite his horrible deeds, I could not help but empathize with him, and even root for him at times. Other characters who appear occasionally, such as Ray, are also brought to life with great care and a conflicted array of emotions that is compelling to watch.\"Being Human\" does a great job of creating an engaging, enjoyable episode for each week during its first season. More importantly, the continuing story arc was told in excellent fashion, never shying away from embracing REAL consequence, interesting questions, and just the right tone of mystery and mayhem.

I loved the show's concept and the over-arching plot kept me hooked all through the first season. Unfortunately it also had a lot of sketchy characterizations and unconvincing moments that can plague a high-concept show (especially one just starting out). While I wouldn't call this U.S. remake \"better\" than the original (and I'm not sure how necessary it is with the original still airing and available in the U.S.) it does manage to avoid some of it's pitfalls and is a pretty entertaining show in it's own right.The story of 'Being Human' revolves around Vampire Aidan, Werewolf Josh and Ghost Sally who share an apartment while trying to lead normal \"human\" lives. All three have their weaknesses and much like original show their \"conditions\" are treated like curses instead of gifts (Aidan's still addicted to living blood, Josh can't control his transformations, Sally can't interact with anyone outside these two). The plot of this first season more-or-less follows the original's story with Aidan's conflicts with his mentor/tormentor Bishop (the vampire who turned him) fueling the best episodes. We do get a lot more exposition with this U.S. remake (being 13 episodes instead of the original six) and everything is played out a bit more reserved than the original show but it does lack some of the biting-humor and freshness the UK series had.Much like the writing and directing, the characterizations in the U.S. 'Being Human' are dialed-down but I found them a bit more palatable (and likable). I was caring about Aidan, Josh and Sally right off the bat thanks to the performances by Sam Witwer, Sam Huntington and Meaghan Rath. The best performance comes from Mark Pellegrino as Bishop and the scenes between him and Witwer really crank up the suspense (especially in the season finale).All in all I found the U.S. 'Being Human' a very entertaining show.

After all, for every successful translation (The Office) of a British gem, there are dozens of failed attempts (Coupling). While I'm sure that I will anger the many avid fans of the original show, I will say that its first season (for me) was wildly uneven. I enjoyed the progress into later years as the plotting became darker and more complex--but while the show had an initial charm, it wasn't perfectly formed right out of the gate. So I was open-minded to this reboot. While some loyalists will contend that it is an utter failure and some newbies will proclaim it is brilliant, I fall squarely in the middle. Once again, I find myself thinking this is a good show with the potential to grow into something far richer and more rewarding. The British version started as an enjoyment and turned into great television. I think that the U.S. version has the same opportunity.For those new to the concept of \"Being Human,\" it is perhaps one of the most unique and (let's admit it) most ridiculous ones on TV. In its outrageousness, however, it is completely irresistible! What if a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire shared living quarters as best mates? You think the trials of tribulations of being young and attractive in the big city makes for great drama--try adding this supernatural component for a bit of fun. Sam Witwer has an intensity perfectly suited to the role of a tortured blood sucker. Sam Huntington has a goofy appeal as a befuddled werewolf. And Meaghan Rath is a serviceable and pleasant apparition. In my opinion, the cast between the two versions is on a relatively even playing field. I actually prefer Witwer in Season One, Rath is somewhat blander yet also less annoying, and Huntington (while incredibly likable) has a hard time measuring up Russell Tovey's pitch perfect creation. Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate Huntington's easy charm, but Tovey (with Sinead Keenan as Nina) give two of the most underrated performances on contemporary British TV.The premise of the show is that the three roomies crave normalcy above all else. But it's not an easy road. The first couple of episodes stick very firmly to the British template, but then the scripts branch out in a welcome way. Primary plot points in this season include Huntington's courtship of a new girlfriend, Rath's investigation into her untimely death, and Witwer's political struggle trying to extricate himself from a vampiric organization. Witwer's plot line has the most meat and is very well done. With terrific character pieces by Mark Pellegrino and Terry Kinney, this arc is the primary reason to catch this incarnation of \"Being Human.\" The trio of leads plays off one another with ease, but have yet to develop the chemistry of their British counterparts. All in all, though, I think the show holds promise and the potential to grow. If you've never seen the original, I think that you'll have much to appreciate here--if for no other reason, the concept is so strikingly different. For fans of the original, I suppose a mixed reaction is to be expected--but I, for one, was willing to go with the flow and enjoy myself.

I love it, love the actors and acting and feel it is a great show. It was with some trepidation that I finally decided to watch the U.S. version. Needless to say I was underwhelmed. I already think it's weird and more than a little creepy that apparently there is so little original material floating around on TV and at the movies that anything that reeks of any success is snatched up and copied over and over again ad nauseum. I hate the word \"reboot\" for anything but computers and this TV show, which I dub a complete ripoff is no exception.Yes, they don't exactly copy the BBC version but there's still plenty of similar enough plot lines for me to wonder about the ethics of whoever is writing the show. Can't come up with something original? Fine, watch the U.K. version then alter the plot lines a bit, rename the characters and call it a brand-new endeavor. Riiight. And part of what I love about the U.K. version is that the people actually look like real people, men and women that I know and would actually talk to--even the pretty and handsome ones. In short, they're real people and I love that since it gives the show an added depth of reality that keeps one believing in the plot no matter how outlandish it gets. The US. version however again gives us Ken and Barbie Doll perfection with people who look like mannequins grabbed off a runway from Paris or Italy. Honestly they could slap those same characters into an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 or The OC or Dawson's Creek and no one would even notice the difference. Whereas if George, Nina, Annie, Tom or Mitchell found themselves on one of those shows the first words out their mouths would likely be, \"Bloody hell, what's all this nonsense? Do you people even know how to hoover let alone stake a vampire who's trying to kill your mates?\"Where the U.K. version actually manages to say something intelligent about the human condition in all its facets and at the same time pack in some very funny, touching clever little moments the U.S. version is just another pale bloodless version of pretty people with problems--or in this case pretty supernatural people with problems.

Not hating cause Eureka is one of my favorite shows ever. Being Human is nothing like that.

The characters that make up this world are not incredibly over dramatic (twilight) or insanely over the top (True Blood: The Complete First Season). This show manages to find an impressive balance between the two giving it a feel all its own.The conflict feels organic as well. For Aidan, his past very long past is finally catching up with him, and he must decide between that past and his present. Sally struggles with no longer being connected, and also the loss of her loved ones. Josh desperately wants to be normal, but that is hard to do when every so often you transform into an uncontrollable killing machine. Each of these plot lines intersect at a certain point and they are handled beautifully.While watching this series my father noticed one day, and sat down to see what all the fuss was about.

It's a city where you can dress as Gandalf and unicycle through the streets while bagpiping... and nobody will look at you twice. Seriously, google it.And that is the city you find in &#34;Portlandia: Season 1,&#34; a hilarious sketch show starring Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein. Even if you've never been to Portland, you'll recognize the weird, wacky types of people in this series from SOMEWHERE -- as well as the affectionate ribbing of a fantastical city devoted to hipsterism, kookery and organic awareness.It begins in Los Angeles, where a guy (Armisen) tells his female buddy (Brownstein) about the magical city of Portland, where all the hot girls wear glasses, you can sleep in till eleven, &#34;young people go to retire,&#34; and you're encouraged to be weird. In short, the dream of the '90s is alive in Portland -- and honestly, even if you're not a Portlander (past or present), it will still entertain.Admittedly I have never been to Portland, and thus I cannot truly say whether the kooky sketches are representative of the population there. But it has a number of people and scenarios that, honestly, your average person will be familiar with, including:*Toni and Candace, a pair of humorless, hypersensitive women running a feminist bookstore, who make life difficult for everyone who enters.*Peter and Nance, a pair of socially-conscious people who end up sucked into a polygamist cult.*Portland's cool mayor (Kyle MacLachlan), who hates Seattle and has a secret, not-very-shocking habit.*Hostile hipsters who bicycle like crazy people and trash their workplaces.*Lance and Nina, who engage in odd sexual antics, involving a safe word (&#34;Cacao!&#34;) and a mysterious box.*Aimee Mann becoming a cleaning lady at the house of two psychotic fans.*The Blunderbuss Festival, a music and arts festival where Sparkle Pony tries desperately to play her guitar, and Gus Van Sant presents a short movie about a woman (Selma Blair) who is repulsed by her hot sweet adoring husband.And... a hide and seek league, hardcore bicycle enthusiasts, Japanese tourists and their pug, dumpster-divers, people who read EVERYTHING, cell phone kiosks, hippie girls, labyrinthine ad agencies, massage rockers, unemployment commercials, artisanal light bulbs, watching movies (and cooking) outdoors, putting a bird on everything... and so on.Okay, it might be a slight exaggeration to say that everybody will recognize the people in this series -- for instance, I don't know (of) any delightfully kooky politicians, and I've never worked at an ad agency that specializes in driving you insane. But I have encountered a lot of these in daily life, especially in places like Ann Arbor and Princeton -- and a few are only slight exaggerations.And the slight exaggeration is enough to make the sketches funny -- not surreally absurdist-funny like &#34;Monty Python,&#34; but a quirky, delightfully awkward funny. A lot of the humor is derived from people being snobby about whatever group they're in -- feminists, hipsterism (&#34;_____ is OVER!&#34;), hide-and-seekers -- but there's also a dollop of awkward sex, organic enthusiasm, and occasionally one of those situations that everybody has to deal with, like... trying to negotiate a cell phone plan.Armisen and Brownstein are phenomenal in here, depicting all sorts of people (and sometimes swapping genders, as with Nina and Lance). They're both so straight-faced and enthusiastic, diving into absurd scenarios (like being brainwashed into a polygamous cult and then darting back to a restaurant YEARS LATER) wholeheartedly.And it has a solid supporting cast, often with actors recognizable from elsewhere -- McLachlan as a mayor who goes missing for days and likes sitting on a medicine ball; Steve Buscemi as a guy who needs the bathroom; singers Aimee Mann and Sarah McLachlan; Jenny Conlee and Colin Meloy; Gus Van Sant; Selma Blair; and Heather Graham as a woman who infuriates Toni and Candace by actually loving her boyfriend.&#34;Portlandia: Season 1&#34; is a delightful little sketch show -- and even if you're not familiar with the place, the lightly absurdist approach is charming and funny.

Well, then... you, my friend, need to partake in a strange journey... a journey into Portlandia... a magical, backward world, where \"the dream of the 90s is alive\".This is some of the very finest sketch comedy I have ever seen, on par with \"The Chappelle Show\" and the best segments of \"SNL\". What makes it all the more impressive is that the show relies completely upon its stars, Fred and Carrie, who show a diversity that is nothing short of astounding. These two put it down with every ounce of their heart and soul, and their efforts are clear to see (and much appreciated).I must point out, however, that I'm able to take what one might deem \"extra pleasure\" in this series, for I live near (and work within) the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which is essentially a \"smaller Portland\". Filled with hipsters, weirdos, and goateed maniacs riding fixed gear bikes, Portsmouth is a hilarious, smaller sibling to the its bigger brother, Portland.

It's okay. The quality wavers between a notch above and a notch below most contemporary sketch comedy, though the characters are generally well done -- caricatures that are right on target. Armisen is good in his roles, while Brownstein is less so. The main shortcoming of the program is the shortcoming shared by most current-day comedy: An emphasis on the situation itself rather than on specific quanta of humor. Fifty years ago, the basic unit of comedy was the joke. Optimum execution of the joke put a premium on delivery and timing. Today, however, the joke has largely died out, replaced with the overall situation as that-which-is-to-be-considered-funny. This shift in focus has changed humor from a well-defined verbal/mental exercise to an amorphous display which the audience is to perceive as funny. As a result, delivery and timing are neglected. Moreover, if it's the situation itself which is presumed to be funny, then the corollary is that more of the situation is going to be more funny. All this is a roundabout and perhaps clumsy way of saying that many of the skits just aren't that humorous or witty to begin with, and that they sometimes go on far too long. Too often, the vibe of the show is, \"Watch us because we're funny,\" rather than really being funny. Still, it's diverting enough most of the time. I do still watch it, after all.", "term": "So-so", "id": "8081:1_0"}, "8082:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "I'm going to be cautious in my rating for IFC's \"Portlandia\" due to the divisive nature of the show's reception. I know a lot of people who sampled the show during its six episode Season One run, and the consensus seemed to be split right down the middle. Some called the show hilarious, while some found it a belabored missed opportunity. Almost nobody was left standing in the middle. Obviously, if you already love or hate the show, nothing in any review is going to change your mind. My commentary is mainly focused on new viewers who might be thinking about trying the program out. I might suggest you try to catch an episode on IFC (they rerun frequently) for free, but also on Amazon Instant Video if you don't have that network on your cable provider. I can understand why some would really connect with the show's ideology but I can also see why some would be less enthused by its meandering presentation. For myself, I did love the premise of the show but oftentimes thought sketches needed to be tightened up.The Good: \"Portlandia,\" first and foremost, starts with a fantastic idea. Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein have created a comedy that speaks to a very specific portion of the population. In a perfect recreation of indie hipster angst, the show skewers a world in which people are consumed by political correctness. The beauty of \"Portlandia\" is that it both embraces the self-importance, superiority, and silliness of this extreme sect while poking gentle fun with it. It really is spot-on in showcasing this dichotomy and Portland stands as an ideal muse for illustrating this too cool for school mentality. The self-aware characters (Armisen and Browstein play a stable of recurring bits) are so proper, in fact, they are often undone by trying to be idealized models of this elevated consciousness. It's an inspired idea, and when it works--it hits very real highs. People relate to the show because they are or know people exactly like the ones represented.The Not-So-Good: Maybe the people that don't connect as much are lacking the relationships necessary to put the show's environment in context. If, for example, you live in Portland or a place like it--it would be hard not to be amused by the premise of the show. However, premise aside, the show sometimes lacks a comedic timing to make even its funniest bits work to perfection. Skits tend to meander a bit, sometimes with a seeming lack of focus. I realize that this is also kind of the point of the premise, but I felt so many sequences went on just a beat too long. If you're looking for big joke based laughs, this is more character driven or situational comedy. Very few moments end in big punchlines. The big laughs, in fact, are infrequent--most of the time, I was gently amused.Armisen and Browstein create some colorful characters (some more successful than others), but the absolute highlight of the season is to catch the unexpected guest stars. Kyle MacLachlin is fantastic as the mayor, Aimee Mann playing herself as a maid is a hoot. Likable Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) pops up, but is underutilized. Steve Buscemi has perhaps the season's most mystifying cameo. And there are a few more surprises, and it's fun to see how many people were willing to drop by for a scene or two. Overall, \"Portlandia\" is a definite (but cautious) recommendation for the right audience. Again, I think its ability to both embrace and satirize the ridiculous is its strongest asset. Season One is six episodes running shy of thirty minutes each. Catch up now, as Season Two starts on IFC in January 2012.

Perhaps a little Ellroy will go a long way--he's a bit of a love it or hate it proposition. Having been a successful writer for thirty years, he has a fascination with the dark side and his obsession invariably led to \"L. A.: City of Demons\"--an original documentary series for the Investigation Discovery network (admit it, you spend hours perusing ID). Ellroy has an inherent fascination with the underbelly of Los Angeles which began with the brutal slaying of his mother and is showcased in some of his most noteworthy books (Black Dahlia, L. A. Confidential). With his larger-than-life personality in full affect and his offbeat verbal stylings in unique form, Ellroy actually kicks off this six episode production with a feature that includes his mother's murder.His potboiler style, nihilism, and noir conventions actually align fairly well with the stories he wishes to share in this series. This probably won't be used as promotional material by the Los Angeles Department of Tourism any time soon.(1) Dead Women Own Me: Ellroy explores cases that have had a real impact on his life and psyche including the aforementioned Black Dahlia and his mother's case.(2) The Scandal Rags: Explores the pulp publications that made notoriety with high profile stories such as the Lana Turner scandal.(3) L. A. Serial Killers: Seems self-explanatory.(4) Dames and Delinquents: Exposes notorious cases that involve organized crime including the murder of a famed mob princess.(5) The Dark Side of Hollywood: A look at celebrity culture.(6) Hot Spot Homicide: A profile on notorious bars, clubs and prohibition era speakeasies.My three star recommendation is an overly cautious warning to viewers that are new to the James Ellroy experience. I could spend hours, personally, with this oddball character. The beauty of Ellroy is that he's his own biggest fan, an unapologetic egotist who fervently believes he is the world's greatest living crime novelist. He may well be--but his unabashed self-idolatry and aggrandizement may be off-putting to those who aren't used to it. In addition to Ellroy, the series really ups the odd quotient with the participation of an animated bull terrier named Barko. Did I just throw you off? Trust me, it is as weird as it sounds. Most of the series and the exchanges with Barko, in particular, seem to exist solely in Ellroy's head. By placing himself front and center (he doesn't share screen time with other real people), Ellroy puts the primary focus on himself. And while I love it, it also pushes the actual show content to a position of less importance. Therefore, I think fans will love it--but I'm not sure if it will be winning new devotees to the cult of Ellroy's greatness. Hence, my neutral rating is largely for the uninitiated.

I also don't think they understand the impact on their own lives such as sacrificing their nutrition and health care to buy food for cats/dogs etc.They're not allowing these animals to have better homes with families that can give them more love and attention and are instead trying to divide their attention among some 80-100 animals.  In the end most cases will adopt out a majority of the pets or see a majority of the pets go to no kill shelters but not before embarrassing and/or humiliating the person completely.  I also doubt the people in these stories will ever get over the loss of their large cache or pets. There should be a better way for them to receive help rather than \"airing all their dirty laundry\" so to speak.As a pet owner (My roommate and I have three cats collectively), I find these shows painful to watch.

I understand wanting to own pets but you should be able to provide a decent, safe environment for both you and your pet.I caution any pet lover to go into these episodes with a strong stomach and be prepared to get very angry and very upset.

Specific to animal hoarders, the use of local humane society or SPCA's were used to rescue the animals.

An intriguing, if not wholly successful, cop show--I will say this one scored huge points for not being a typical procedural tackling a new case each week. Created by Shawn Ryan, the show excelled at depicting the political struggles and manipulations inherent in a government bureaucracy even if it didn't always ring true with its supporting characters and peripheral story lines. But at heart, the show's strengths far outweighed its shortcomings. I came into \"The Chicago Code\" with pretty hefty expectations, I must admit. Ryan created, in my opinion, TV's greatest police drama \"The Shield\" as well as the under appreciated and quirky \"Terriers.\" Both of those shows, however, benefited from being on FX--a network that is able to provide edgier and more realistic fare than traditional networks (this aired on Fox). In most respects, you can see the distinct difference.The show centers around the appointment of a new police commissioner (Jennifer Beals) who vows to tackle corruption and complacency within the Chicago department. Aided by a former colleague and hotshot cop, Jason Clarke, the pair take on cases of particular political volatility. One of their primary targets is a potentially corrupt city alderman played with precision by Delroy Lindo. It is this continuing story line that gives \"The Chicago Code\" its greatest drama and intrigue.The Good: Clarke, a great actor who has been restrained in previous roles, has a chance to really break out here. Beals is an intriguingly complex character. And Lindo, as I mentioned, is riveting. He steals every scene he's in. The action revolving around his plot lines is dynamic and mesmerizing.The Bad: As great as the central characters are, the show falters a bit with its supporting cast. Clarke's niece is also on the force and having a dalliance with her partner. In one episode, this secret relationship is exposed causing a settlement suit to be awarded to a complainant. However, somehow the affair still remains a secret after becoming a part of public record. Huh? And there is an undercover cop in the Irish mob. He's a low level hood that somehow ascends to exactly the position he needs to be in. Very convenient and not at all plausible. Add the fact that he is constantly in contact with Beals and Clarke (even in public venues) and deep undercover has never seemed so shallow. The actors are all fine, the screenplay is just taking unnecessary shortcuts that undermine the show's truthfulness.The Perplexing: This being a network show, Ryan doesn't have the luxury of using realistically colorful language. He, therefore, makes Clarke a character who is offended by the use of curse words (especially in front of children). Okay, I'll buy it--except for one thing. He just substitutes euphemisms for swear words that sound just like swear words. If he were really offended by bad language, his vocabulary would reflect that--he wouldn't just make up new words.All in all, though, I enjoyed the show and think it might have developed into a richer and more rewarding experience. But we'll never know. For Beals, Clarke, and Lindo--this is still an easy recommendation. I'll follow Ryan to his next show (back on cable, I hope) and maybe that one can make it past one season (the great Terriers also didn't get a second season pick-up). If you like cop shows, you'll probably like this one too.

You probably never heard of it though, because in their infinite wisdom, Fox only gave the show three months. The rating weren't spectacular, but they weren't bad either. In June, The Chicago Code became part of Fox's mass cancellation, which saw Dollhouse, Lie To Me, Human Target, and Alcatraz gone in the blink of eye. It begs the question, did the Fox executives ever bother to watch these shows? The Chicago Code was well written, fast-paced, and featured a tremendous cast of new and established talent. If it had been on cable, I have no doubt that this show would still be on the air and at the top of the ratings.The Chicago Code features Jennifer Beals as Superintendent, Teresa Colvin, hired by the Chicago Mayor to help clean up the police force. Colvin has greater ambitions though, as she plans on cleaning up local government and taking on the Irish mob as well. To do this, Colvin covertly puts together a team, that has the power to choose it's own cases and make a case against their prime target, Alderman Ronin Gibbons (Delroy Lindo). Gibbons has been on the city counsel for half a century and thanks to his mob connections, he is considered to be the most powerful politician in Chicago. Everyone knows he's dirty, but the hard part is proving that in a court of law.Colvin's team is led by Detective Jarek Wysocki (Jason Clarke), who has a scarred past, that has led him to his own unique and chaotic way of doing things. Wysocki is paired with a young, ambitious, clean cut college boy, Caleb Evers (Matt Lauria), who tries to keep Wysocki in check, while putting everyone else to shame with his incredible good looks. The third member of the team is an undercover officer, who has infiltrated the mob and is trying to work his way up to the politicians.Every episode contains different stories that follow the shady dealings, some case the pair is working on, the fallout for the Superintendent, and of course the undercover who has an in with the wrong crowd. The stories are edgy, intelligent, and really entertaining. A lot of shows get cancelled every year, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why this show wasn't given more of a chance. The chemistry the cast has, along with the terrific writing, and edge of your seat police drama made The Chicago Code one of the best shows to come out that year.Two years after it's cancellation, the show is still on my mind and in fact, I just recently watched it again, as it's streaming on Netflix. The story of The Chicago Code teaches us one very important thing about network television, it's all about the money!

There may be spoilers here, so if you want to remain a Being Human \"virgin\", don't read below.It is a little tough watching the American version knowing that the BBC version is not only in its 3rd series, but the BBC version is more original simply for having set the stage for SYFY.Don't get me wrong, the American actors are fine and their performances are great, but the british cast \"own\" these roles. It's almost like the Americans are renting theirs. The BBC characters seem more fallible, more realisting, and belong to their roles. It is like the BBC wrote characters to best suit the actors, and in the SYFY version, they did the opposite, but to a somewhat disconcordant effect.That sounds more negative then it is intended, but I did not like the twist at the end of the American season when the werewolf Josh (played by Sam Huntington) is hoodwinked into sitting out the grande finale battle royale. Perhaps the SYFY ending was more fitting, as it felt truer to the logic of their universe.Case in point, a man of twenty-something has very little chance of outfoxing a man of 300 who is perpetually on his toes and a master of his powers (SYFY). What the BBC version suggested is that in the heat of combat both 150-something Mitchell (Aidan Turner) and Herrick [an ancient vampire with full acceptance (and thus, control) of his powers and senses; played by Jason Watkins], are duped by the silly, often-unwieldy George (played by Russel Tovey), one into making ready for a battle royale that will never happen, and the other getting locked in the basement with the werewolf. Herrick HAD to see that coming.In this BBC season-concluding episode, there is faithfulness to each performance and plot that is rarely seen in this type of horror/sci-fi drama.Oh, and Lenora Crichlow is a slamming hotty. Meaghan Rath seems a far more morose, whiny version of the ghostly-friend. I would rather spend eternity with a chipper Annie and her endless tea-making than Sally-sulks-a-lot, moping and pouting. That would drive me bonkers. If Sally doesn't cheer up in season 2 of SYFY, I'm not sure if I can stomach it.Kristen Hager has better looks than Sinead Keenan. That's all I have to say on that matter. It feels like each series picked the correct actress to play across from their dopey werewolf roomie. Still, Nina seems a little more realistic in the role because she's not physically perfect. She is charming, and has a flair for the character. Kristen is believable as a young doctor in Boston, although I can't quite place why her character would hang around with Josh.

The writers manage to throw some interesting curveballs into the characters' lives, but Aidan Turner's tormented vampire is the best part of it all.Nina, George and Mitchell have purchased a small Welsh B&B; as their new home, and everything seems potentially perfect... except Annie is trapped in purgatory, and she's headed for hell. Desperate to save her, Mitchell follows a newly-dead spirit into purgatory, where he is faced with his bloodiest sins -- and a prophecy that a \"werewolf-shaped bullet\" will kill him.So the reunited gang continues trying to have a normal life, grappling with \"normal\" problems and supernatural ones, including a vampiric teenager, a tragic zombie, cage-fights, evil vampire suburbanites, and a pair of werewolves living in the woods. But things take a horrifying turn when George finds that Herrick has somehow come back to life -- and though he doesn't seem to remember who he is/was, he hasn't lost his evil. And after Herrick causes another horrifying incident, Mitchell's desperation will lead to another tragedy...\"Being Human Season Three\" might as well be called the \"Mitchell Season,\" because Aidan Turner really steals the show: Mitchell is tormented by the Box Tunnel Massacre, his fear of being caught, and his ever-growing terror of his impending death. Turner is absolutely sublime, slowly ramping up Mitchell's fear, desperation and erraticism as the season goes on, until it seems like the vampire is about to crack.Not that the other characters get shortchanged, because they get plenty of attention too. Annie really blossoms when she begins an undead romance with Mitchell. George and Nina have to grapple with a very common problem when Nina becomes pregnant, and George also has to deal with his father's recent death.And the writers make this season a pretty solid one, twisting together multiple dark storylines about revenge, hatred, suspicion and (of course) the Box Tunnel Massacre. It grows tenser and bleaker as the season goes on, and the seemingly-solid relationships between the housemates start to fray. And even the one-off plots seem to be a bit darker, although the vampire-teen one was hilarious. It finishes up on the single darkest episode of the whole series.But there are some funny moments (George's repeated lament that \"I only wanted a pee!\"), as well as some touching moments (Nina asking George if he wants to \"have a little hairy baby\" with her).\"Being Human Season Three\" just shows that even vampires and werewolves can't run away from their problems -- and when their problems catch up, things get messy.", "term": "Wolf-shaped bullet", "id": "8235:1_0"}, "8236:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The third season is super dramatic and even tragic. It is the time of resurrection and sacrifice.Annie is brought back to this world by John Mitchell from purgatory. She is back in the world she loves - as a ghost - and WITH the man she loves though she is rather limited along that line. But she assumes a power and an authority she should not even dream of, since she is a ghost. What right does she have to meddle with the affairs of the human world and what's more with the business of a vampire and the punishment he deserves for being a killer? If you don't want the man or the person you love to be a killer you better not love that person if he/she is a killer. But to reform a killer, especially a vampire, is like wanting the sun to rise in the west.What's more that Annie becomes the easy prey of another dead ghost, one of the victims of John Mitchell's in the Tunnel Box 20 massacre, a student in the real world when she was alive, who is absolutely exclusively leaning towards vengeance, trying to bend the world of the living towards her own ends and predicting that Mitchell will be killed by a werewolf, though she knows she has no foreseeing power. How could she since she was not even able to avoid taking the train that was going to lead to her death. Once a seer forever a seer but if you are not a seer from the very start you will never be a seer ever ever.George, the werewolf, and his enamoured Nina, find their life very complicated when Nina discovers she is pregnant with a monster that was impregnated into her on a full moon episode, and when in their adventures they get to know and help two other werewolves who are hunted by vampires and particularly the band of Herrick's aficionados - a Herrick who is officially dead, killed by George by dismembering, which is not kosher for a vampire - because the two werewolves killed quite a few of these vampires, well more than a few, quite a lot indeed. But we will find out that Herrick is a bloody torturer, organizing dog fights between human beings and werewolves on full moon nights. That way a certain McNair wins but is scratched by the werewolf he kills and becomes a werewolf himself. That's life of course: one cannot win on all sides at the same time. There is always a flaw in the beautiful picture of a victory. But this McNair is important because of the \"son\" he brings into the picture, a young man who was made a werewolf some time in Scotland and this Tom McNair is a very effective vampire killer especially when Herrick kills his \"father\".That's one of the twists of this third season: Herrick who was not properly killed with a stake in his heart, but dismembered by George comes back full and healthy though without his memory. But he will recapture that one and then will become an avenging vampire, but he will fail getting a fight between George and Mitchell, thanks to Tom McNair and then John Mitchell will have to do what was not done properly before: never entrust to anyone what you can and should do yourself, because that's cowardice and totally misguided because your substitute will never do things properly, that is to say the way you would like them to be done.But all that is brought up by the insistence on the side of a female inspector or someone/something in a police uniform to arrest John Mitchell for the Tunnel Box 20 massacre. She will succeed as for that but then a real massacre will ensue because that will trigger Herrick's recovery of his memory.The last point here is that the series tried to widen the scope and bring the Old Ones into the picture, the vampires who are more than one thousand years old. They want to recuperate John Mitchell as something like their killing Cerberus and the confrontation is dramatic. John Mitchell wants George to kill him. The representative of the Old Ones wants to recuperate John Mitchell. George does not want to kill John Mitchell but he cannot let him become a killing machine in the hands and at the tips of the fangs of a bunch of old cronies who want to declare the age of the vampire finally reached and the authority of vampires over the whole world finally achieved.But George Sands loves John Mitchell and he cannot eternally hide his head in the sand of some desert: his dilemma is between loving and killing, not killing because loving and killing because loving. Can one kill someone because they love them? That's the dramatic last scene or nearly of the third season. Will John Mitchell crumble into ashes or not? But this love scene between two \"men\" is absolutely marvellous in intensity and yet modesty: two men can love each other that intensively and yet keep that love where it belongs first of all and above all, in their soul, in their mind, in their mental spiritual force and power.If he does kill John Mitchell the future of the series is bleak and will require a miracle to undo what love has brought up. If he does not all morality and ethics are out of this perverse series that becomes the melting pot of all crimes in the name of love.You choose your favourite solution and you enjoy that suspense.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU", "term": "Johgn Mitchell as the King of Wales", "id": "8236:1_0"}, "8237:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Love this program.

But it's a religion in which God plays little.  Unlike prior seasons, this one has little mention of organized religion or church, and when George stands over a dying man, he can't even remember the words to the Shema.  Instead, this religion pits the communion of the house against the greedy individualism of the larger world.This bleak vision of Wales, all shabby brick and abandoned industrial iron, creates a look of despair and desolation.  Which probably explains why they have the Hawaii mural in their house: they've build a paradise within their own walls.  In a significant deleted scene from episode 2, Annie calls Mitchell her \"saviour.\"  These characters' ad hoc religion lets them resist a bleak and godless world through the sacrament of just remaining together.Notably, when Mitchell crosses into the afterlife to retrieve Annie, he describes the place he finds as \"Purgatory.\"  The place of purging, where sins are expunged by recognition and contrition.  This religion doesn't have much need for Heaven or Hell, God or Satan, but it prizes guilt and culpability.  The only hope against encroaching struggle and despair comes in unity and society.  Notice how militantly individualistic the other vampires and werewolves are.This makes their house a monastery.  The characters eat together, find love within their own walls, and \"pray\" as a group by standing together against their damaged natures.  But without a shared theology, they have to face their sins directly.  Without Jesus to save or Buddha to guide, their religion makes them remember their sins over and over again.  They persevere, not to save their own souls, but because they can only be saved together.This season's deep immersion in death and the afterlife is much darker than previous seasons.  As our heroes aid zombies while fighting wolves and vampires, they stand together against the world, becoming stronger only as a group.

Wow, was I wrong. I don't care for cop shows, nor would I have thought that I would enjoy a show set in Kentucky where most of the characters are hillbililes, but I have fallen in love with this show.  All of which proves, it's wise not to pre-judge or stereotype.Like all excellent shows, what makes Justified shine is the acting and the writing.  The characters are first rate.  You really start to care about Raylan, the marshals and even the criminals like Boyd.  Timothy Olyphant is extremely charismatic as Raylan.  You can't help but root for this guy.  He is a throwback from the old gunslingers of the wild west.  His courage and sense of humor make him a fun character to watch.  His foil Boyd Crowder is just as well done.  Walter Goggins' acting is superb.  In a way, his character goes through a lot more changes than Raylan's.  He starts out a criminal that likes to blow things up, and goes through a miraculous religous conversion, but it's interesting, no matter how hard he tries to change and follow the 'path of righteousness,' he just can't escape his family's criminal roots.  The friendship, if you could call it that, between Raylan and Boyd is extremely interesting.  On one hand they're old mining buddies, on the other hand, they've chosen a different path in life that puts them at odds. Sometimes they work together, as they did against the Florida hit men, other times Raylan is cuffing Boyd and locking him up.  It's a unique, and extremely interesting relationship.In Season 2, among the standout acting was Margo Martindale's Mags.  Talk about a powerful woman.  Her 3 sons, all respect and are afraid of her.  Gotta love Nick Searcy as Art, Natalie Zea as Winona, Joelle Carter as Ava and Jacob Pitts as Tim.  All of the supporting characters are extremely well acted.  The dialogue at times, by characters like Boyd, Wynn Duffy and Dickie Bennett is just superb, border-line modern Shakespearean.One of my favorite moments from Season 2 came when Raylan had caught up with Dickie and was either going to shoot him or arrest him for the death of Aunt Helen. Up to that point, Raylan had not said a word about his feelings about her loss.  When Raylan started talking to Dickie about his feeilngs for his Aunt Helen, it brought me to tears.  To me, that was one of the most powerful moments of the season.For me, Justified is a true sleeper.  Fantastic show.

There is nothing particularly unique about the format of the show which mirrors countless other elimination programs across the television landscape.  But with the subject matter being guns and recreational shooting, the show really caters to a widespread sport that you don't see embraced very often in traditional programming.  Thus, lovers of target practice and marksmanship have a show that they can call their own.  It's not an exclusive club, however, those that love reality competitions but have never been to a shooting range can also have a bit of fun.  The show has the expected reality quirks that you either embrace or loathe.  There's quick cut editing for dramatic affect, enthusiastic but obvious commentary from the host (\"It's a hit\" Survivor alum Colby Donaldson might exclaim despite the fact that we've just watched the impact), and eliminations that are based just as much on politics and game-playing as opposed to outright talent (due to team competitions).Season Two of \"Top Shot\" doesn't reinvent the formula of the first season.  It does, however, try to liven things up.  This season there are sixteen competitors (14 men and 2 women) striving to avoid the episodic eliminations.  While some of the weapons and challenges claim to be inspired by history (as a nod to the network), this component is not as developed as it might be.  Various stunts include shooting from a moving vehicle or while being suspended and new weapons are introduced.  In addition to a variety of guns, the show also samples other weapons such as blow guns, bows, and hatchets.DVD Info:  4 Discs contain all 13 episodes from this season at approximately 9 hours and 45 minutes.  It is called \"Top Shot: Reloaded\" as it includes approximately 85 minutes of bonus footage with features entitled The Top Shot Experience, Extended Team Selection, Weapons Rundown, and Anatomy of a Shot.  If you watched and enjoyed the first season, this is an easy recommendation.  If you are new to the show, though, you might sample an episode first.  It is not particularly groundbreaking but it is an enjoyable diversion for shooting enthusiast and reality show fanatics.

A head explodes!!)The one thing that sort of spoils the moment is the cop in the beginning who serves as the introduction of the film.

I'm NOT kidding!

This entire scene went completely over my head and seemed unnecessary and confusing.  I understand that people wanted to see (using binoculars) the tire actually destroy everything in its path- THIS made sense, but why did they feel the need to stuff themselves with so much food?Well none of that really matters however, because once the tire finds its way rolling down the desert highway, by a gas station and more importantly involved in a hotel room, things just get completely wild.Just a perfect nonsense film really.

While I loved every scene which has the star, Robert T. Tire in it, I did get a bit bored w/ the ramblings of the desert audience. The problems that RUBBER has are human failings, not the fault of any steel-belted object. Had this film been a 20-30 min. short film, it would be a classic. At an hour and twenty minutes, it's a slog. Breaking the fourth wall is nothing new, but it has been done w/ far more finesse and less tedium (hell, Hope and Crosby did it 60+ years ago!). As for surreal, absurd parts that take us behind the scenes / out of the movie, that's pretty old as well (examples: BLAZING SADDLES, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL).

Meanwhile, a group of spectators watch from afar, occasionally commenting on the carnage. The point? To have no point. To be completely without reason. And RUBBER proves its point very well. In fact, it may even be the most pointless film ever made! The silly premise is much better suited for the short film format, where its punch line would go off without a hitch instead of dragging it on to feature length. It provides only momentary satisfaction when Robert inquisitively inspects his surroundings and blows the heads off of innocent desert creatures in a fit of gory rage. Quentin Dupieux opens the film with a pretentious monologue about the pointlessness of cinema that immediately establishes his sense of self-importance. In other words, he is telling the audience they are not intelligent enough to understand that this is satire, so he spells it out for them. That does not make RUBBER any less clever or entertaining in small doses, however. RUBBER is unique enough in concept to warrant a view.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies", "term": "Rubber", "id": "8517:1_0"}, "8518:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Hollywood is full of adaptations, sequels, prequels, remakes, re-imaginings, reboots, and spin-offs. The bottom line is that most movies hitting the big screen are familiar territory. When something original does come along, it usually \"borrows\" elements from films that influenced it or pays homage to said influential films that came before it. Truth be told, at this stage in the game, technically everything has already been done. Everything has already been written about or filmed or drawn or created digitally. All that's really left out there is the really bizarre topics. The stuff that you either think up randomly one slow Thursday evening or is obviously the result of one of the heaviest acid trips in history. I like to think that Rubber falls somewhere in the middle...of all three categories.Rubber pretty much had me at Lieutenant Chad's (Stephen Spinella) opening monologue. Hell, he gets out of the trunk of a car just to illustrate the point of \"no reason.\" What makes this scene special is that it kind of breaks the fourth wall while also introducing the secondary storyline of the film. Lieutenant Chad explains what we are about to see to the camera and then it's revealed that there is a crowd of people there who are also about to watch what transpires on screen. Mind you, they're watching with binoculars and their fates are kind of questionable given the film's primary storyline, but it was one of the more unique ways to start off a film.Rubber is Robert's story. Who is Robert, you may ask? Robert's a tire; a car tire, to be precise. He wakes up one day to find out he likes to roll over anything that gets in his way, but once something more solid crosses his path like a beer bottle is when things get even crazier. Robert discovers that he has telepathic powers and he uses this gift to make things explode. It starts with a beer bottle and shifts to animals. As Robert lives life to the fullest just rolling around the desert and blowing up whatever his little nonexistent heart desires, he eventually stumbles onto a road into town where he becomes fixated with a woman. Not only that, but we get to see how his special powers work on humans...It's difficult to fully describe a film like Rubber. Its genius use of absurdity is practically overwhelming. The acting is a bit over the top at times, but really solid overall and fits the overall tone of the film like a glove. Stephen Spinella practically steals the show, but Jack Plotnick definitely has his moments. Okay, you got me. It's mostly the turkey scene and his heart to heart with the man in the wheelchair (Wings Hauser) that made Plotnick relevant. Rubber offers a little bit of everything though; comedy, drama, horror. There are a few seriously memorable one-liners buried in the film (\"No, come on. It's not real life. Look at you, you have a stuffed toy alligator under your arm.\") and it's kind of incredible how you almost come to understand the thought process of a car tire by the time the film ends.Rubber certainly isn't going to be a film for everyone, but you pretty much know what you're getting into with the trailer. The people who hate it probably have justifiable reasons; it's ridiculous, it's unbelievable, it's impossible; it's the dumbest thing ever. It's hard to argue with any of that, but I loved it for all of those reasons. Some people may see ridiculousness, but I saw originality, creativity, and unpredictability. Isn't that better than most of the clich&eacute; tripe that somehow makes all this money at the box office?Rubber is brainless fun covered by a veil of uncertainty. If you can accept the outlandish premise, then it's incredibly entertaining. Rubber has that same kind of vibe that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans does; it's bizarre and eccentric on the surface, but kind of brilliant at its core. It'd probably be fair to call Rubber cheese, as well. But dammit if it's not some of the richest cheese I've ever tasted.", "term": "A genius use of absurdity.

And, as you may expect, none of it really makes sense.The acting is solid, but ultimately inconsequential--which is perhaps the film's biggest flaw.  When your star is a mute piece of rubber, you need solid directing and interesting visuals to keep the audience's attention.  Initially, Dupieux delivers; the open scene is beautifully orchestrated, and there are other killer (pun intended) scenes as well.  But it doesn't really add up.  Which is largely Dupieux's point, of course; he's making a statement here.  The problem is, his message doesn't come across too clear.

I think along withWinter's Bone,127 Hours, a cute littleNorwegian mockumentary about trolls, and Miike's amazing samurai epic13 Assassins, Rubber is one of the film's that stood out for 2010.  This is not just an outstanding satire of less than desirable films that are the result of consumerism, but Rubber manages to skewer all of Hollywood at large.  It is both a film-within-film kind of commentary on some of the mediocrity mainstream film-goers will accept as worthy filmmaking, but it also manages to stand as a straightforward entertaining yarn provided you can appreciate absurd dark humor.  It is full of appropriate metaphors while also remaining true to the genre it primarily targets.  Fans who appreciate horror-comedies and the humor within ridiculous science fiction concepts will understand what Rubber is setting out to do, but in the end Rubber's intentions are even clearer; taking itself seriously would be the biggest violation toward reason of all.Rubber starts out with a fantastic monologue by Stephen Spinella, who is absolutely on the ball with the film's overall thesis and delivers a remarkably enthusiastic performance.  He is apparently telling a story about a murderous tire with psychokinetic powers and he is staging a live performance in front of about twenty or so gluttonous audience members who spectate from the desert with their binoculars.  Several lines suggest that they are actually watching a movie.  Its obvious mockery will rub some viewers the wrong way, especially while at the same time it is contrasted by a tire blowing people's heads up repeatedly, which of course I found wildly funny.  Absurdist work is always polarizing and I'm sure many will not feel compelled to appreciate Rubber's odd narrative, but I sure did.The film is meticulously handled.  Every single character, every single line, every single shot in Rubber is handled as a part of the film, but it is the way in which its title character is humanized that makes Rubber a special film.  He is a lost character within the desert that must dust himself off and keep soldiering on.  He is ignored and misunderstood by those who would not think twice but throw him onto a pile with others of his ilk and light him ablaze.  In the end he is bent on bringing with him the apocalypse aided by his fellow rubber friends and his powerful telekinesis.  It is exactly that kind of sternness in Rubber coupled with its genuinely hilarious slapstick in other moments that make it simply unforgettable, but above all else Rubber remains a poignant commentary on movie making in general.

Not only that, but this tire has the ability to kill with the power of its \"mind.\"  There is NO reason that this tire comes to life, nor is there a reason it has homicidal tendencies.  It just does.  In fact, the conceit of this movie is so random that we are told (literally told) that the movie is an \"homage to no reason.\"  And it certainly is.The idea of the film is undeniably amusing.  That someone even came up with the idea is worth applauding.  And the method in which the story is told and the film is crafted is undeniably amusing.  Writer/director Quentin Dupieux has made a film that is bit more theatre-of-the-absurd than it is a horror movie.  The main character (a sheriff played by Stephen Spinella, a great stage actor who looks just a little surprised to be in this film) frequently talks to the audience, and the \"audience\" is a character too.  Randomness is the order of the day, thus virtually no character behaves in predictable ways.RUBBER is a terrific 40 minute movie.  Sadly, the movie is actually 80+ minutes, so it is a shaggy dog joke that quickly wears out its welcome.  The natural lengthy of this amusing but slight concept is stretched past the breaking point by either a) too much effort to be clever, which finally comes off as just TOO random or b) endless shots of the tire rolling across the desert.  Not surprisingly, the tire has little personality and little it can do beyond roll or stand still...and watching it do these 2 things is not terribly exciting (I was amused when the tire took a deliberate dip in a swimming pool).The film, which I watched on blu-ray, has some lovely desert scenery.  But other than Spinella, it has a Grade-Z cast, which might be okay in a straight horror movie, but here it just adds to the level of oddness.  The film is a joke on the audience, but with this cast, it also appears to be a joke on the performers, who have no sense of motivation or purpose.  \"Just say the oh-so-clever lines...don't worry about why.\"If you're in the mood for a strange but exciting, bloody, gory or scary movie...RUBBER is NOT it.

It tells a silly tale indeed: that of a homicidal, psychotic tire (named Robert, the trailer tells us, though that is never mentioned in the film) who goes on a murderous rampage at a hotel in the middle of the California desert, and the cadre of law enforcement officials on Robert's tail.It looks like, not to put too fine a point on it, just about the dumbest, funniest movie you could possibly want to see. At one point, the trailer also calls the film \"visionary\". I assumed that was meant, like I assumed everything else in the trailer was meant, as a joke.I have never been more wrong with an assumption in my life. And I have never been as happy to be that wrong.Because the trailer does such a great job at hiding so much of what makes this movie great, and because the reviews of the movie I've read surprisingly do the same thing, I will do my best to dance around the parts of this movie that no one has told you about yet even while noting that they are the parts of the movie that make you really, really want to see it. Unfortunately, that precludes a plot synopsis other than what you get from the trailer (which I recapped above). I will go as far as to tell you that the rest of the plot, which is far more interesting than the sentient-killer-tire bit, poses a lot of the same questions Michael Haneke did in &lt;em>Funny Games&lt;/em> vis-a-vis the way in which an audience consumes a film. But where Haneke's films always feel kind of artificial to me (this is not a criticism; I'm a huge fan of Bela Tarr, how could I criticize artificiality?), Dupieux takes that artificiality and blows it up to six-foot-tall-neon-red letters and tattoos it across the forehead of this movie. It is so completely absurd that it works. It is the best movie I have seen of its kind since Peter Greenaway's infamous, and long-banned, 1993 film &lt;em>The Baby of Mcon&lt;/em> (yes, including Haneke). I will say right up front that this is a movie that thrives on its own meta-ness, as do &lt;em>Funny Games&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Baby of Mcon&lt;/em> (one could even draw a comparison, perhaps, to Makavejev's &lt;em>Sweet Movie&lt;/em>); if that's not your cup of tea, this won't be, either. And if you're looking for a straight horror comedy, that is not what this is at all. I suspect those two factors account for much of the film's low rating at various movie sites (68% at Rotten Tomatoes as I write this and 5.8 at IMDB), but that's the risk Dupieux took in keeping so much of the genius of this movie hidden.

It is also funny to see the tire and the way it explores, basically playing king of the road with anything in its path. It likes to stomp and, not being able to, it steps it up. The tire is one element, too, but the way it plays out would have either sunk or allowed the movie to swim.

RUBBER is one of those movies.RUBBER is a movie about a killer tire. The film opens with a man (Jack Plotnick) standing out in the middle of the desert covered in binoculars. Then a car comes driving up a dirt road destroying a bunch of wooden chairs that have been set up as though they were orange safety cones. The car stops and a man in a police uniform (Stephen Spinella) gets out and begins talking into the camera. He gives a long monologue about in every great movie there is an element of something happening for \"no reason\" and that's what this movie is all about. He then dumps out the beverage in his hand and jumps back into the car and is driven off. Then the man with the binoculars begins passing out binoculars to a group of spectators standing behind roped off pillars. The people take their binoculars and turn around and begin watching the movie. Throughout the rest of the film RUBBER moves back and forth between the action of Robert the Tire and the audience. Towards the end of the movie, the audience actually becomes a part of the movie.So, with the absurdist theatre element in place, the main \"action\" follows the deeds of Robert the Tire. It's never explained in the movie how or why (and Robert isn't even given a name, except in the special features and in promotional materials) Robert comes to be. He just rises out of the dirt and is. It takes him some time to get adjusted to just standing up and then rolling around of his own accord. But soon he's off and rolling. Then he comes across a plastic bottle in his way and he flattens it. Next a scorpion in his way meets the same fate. However, the next object is a glass bottle and Robert can't flatten that. This seems to upset him so tries to destroy it with his mind and succeeds in making it explode. So, now Robert is a living tire who has a type of pyrokinesis, he can't make things explode with his mind. Robert quickly moves from exploding bottles to exploding living things.In some ways RUBBER is a critique at the way Hollywood and the studios usually make movies. It's an insane process that doesn't make any sense to most people and often even confounds those in the movie business. I know there are countless times I've left a film thinking, \"How did they get to make that?!\" RUBBER pokes fun of that and the way that most people are just there to watch a good show.

In regard to the script: The writer (also director Max Winkler) plays his cards close to his chest. The viewer sees certain things going on fairly early on. But other things he metes out, bit by bit, to fill in the spaces. I also like the characters, warts and all. No one here is a really good person, but none is really bad either. They all just have a lot of baggage and it gets in the way of their dealing with one another. I thought the dialogue, particularly Sam's, was outstanding. And Michael Angarano, delivers Sam's lines with great aplomb. Reece Thompson, as Marshall, does an equally fine job as a person traumatized by a violent attack a year earlier. Uma Thurman has a face you can't take your eyes off and she's as good as always here. Lee Pace might be too much of a caricature as the self absorbed actor and Uma's beau, but, for my dollar, that was the only down side to the flick.All the production values are of a professional level. There are some nifty tunes on hand that well underscore the story. There is a subtle (maybe not so) gay thing going on between the two leads and it is vague.

Though it was made in 2010 and released on Demand TV  before its ultimate release on theaters, it is hopefully going to gather the audience it so richly deserves.  It is a young work: the writer/director is Max Winkler, son of Henry Winkler, a bright young talent who essentially makes his debut with little sparkler. Not only has he come up with a fresh idea for a story but he has also matched that story with a script that is at all times warmly entertaining and at many points a sensitive, philosophical examination of relationships today. And he has cast the film with some of the finest young actors on screen at present.Sam Davis (Michael Angarano, a brilliant young actor in his early 20s, so memorable in the deeply touching 'One Last Thing') writes children's books and lives in the child like fantasies of kids.  He has a friend Marshall Schmidt (Reece Thompson, another early 20s bright young talent) who happens to show up as the only member of an audience to hear Sam read his latest new children's book.  The two boys rekindle their friendship, stagnant for the past year while Marshall recovered from an altercation and hid in his parents home while Sam had a momentary encounter with a beautiful 30s something woman Zoe (Uma Thurman).  The two lads decide to take a little trip to ostensibly to get Marshall out of his parent's home to see the world, but in actuality Sam has heard that Zoe is marrying some wealthy guy, Whit Coutell (Lee Pace, another brilliant actor remembered for his shattering performance in 'Soldier's Girl'), at Whit's lavish seaside home.Sam and Marshall mend long absent feelings of closeness and taking some daring steps they drive to the seaside estate, obtain an invitation to Zoe's party (her wedding to Whit Actually) from Zoe's drunken brother Teddy (Jake  M. Johnson).  Sam confronts Zoe, stating his love and his desire to marry her, but Zoe needs more than a young kid to satisfy her and sees the opportunities of marrying the moneyed Whit.  In a series of incidents both hilarious at times and deeply tender at others all characters discover new concepts of relationships.  How the film ends is left for the viewer to discover.Michael Angarano is pitch perfect as Sam, a young man whose ideals are tested and who must learn the adult role.  His skills are so polished at this young stage in his career that he is bound to become a major star.  Reece Thompson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman gives one of her most well rounded performances.  Lee Pace makes the most of his role, sparkling as the reigning optimist of the story.

He finds a way to try and crash her remote upstate New York wedding and pre-party while using his friend as a cushion and unbeknownst helper. The story has some comedic, yet realistic moments highlighted by the best performance (and comic relief role) in the film with Jake Johnson playing the perpetually drunk brother of the bride.The Blu quality is standard, with there being some nice views of the island they filmed at and around. The clarity is not superb or benchmark, nor is the DTS - and the yellow lens bled out the brightness, like Winkler was trying to make it look retro (which when you let the menu play customers thought it looked like a 70s film). The weakness of this product though are the Blu supplements, which in this volume of bad quality makes it hard for me to rate the product any higher than four:* Deleted scenes, 2 minutes. Glad they were cut as they would have made for some tedious additions.* Outtakes, 2:35 minutes. Unfunny and could have been left off the disc.* Extended scene, 2:36 minutes. The only supplement I liked - it was from the dinner table scene and involved more Jake Johnson comedy (I remember him most as the roommate inNo Strings Attached (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)), mistake to cut it.* Making of, 21:47 minutes. A very dry interview and clip laden piece with the mains and director dissecting their roles and love for each other, skipper.* Max Winkler Makes Ceremony, 8:18 minutes. A strange mix of tabletop interviews and behind the scenes showcasing his thinking out loud process. I suppose any huge fans of his will want to see this.* Behind the scenes footage, 7:17 minutes. Big mistake to include this as it was either meant to show how bored people were in between takes, or was providing a yearbook clip of the moments wanting to be forgotten during production, skipper.* A Year in a Tent, 3:50 minutes. The full length clip/short film of Lee Pace's character in Africa. LoDef and slightly tedious, but worth the watch if you liked the clips left in the film.* HDNet promo, 4:25 minutes. Did not even look HD and grabbed quips from the other supplements here.English language with subs in same and Spanish. I did not see any real benchmark Blu clarity on sound or picture (though still worthy to see) and the supplements were hopefully a lesson in how-to and what not to include for this first-time feature director.

It is a worthy continuation of this fine series of British detective shows which have charmed so many.Although I would expect those who are reading this to be familiar with the characters and the setting I will briefly summarize the key points about this series. The stories take place in the fictional county of Midsomer, England. The major city in the area is Causton where Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby has his office. Causton is surrounded by a series of around 56 smaller villages where most of the stories take place. The scenery is usually very lovely English villages and countryside which alone is of interest. Tom is married to a patient, and mostly understanding wife named Joyce, played by Jane Wymark, who is fascinated by the lovely villages surrounding Causton. Tom and Joyce have one daughter, Cully (named after the lake in Switzerland where she was conceived) played by Laura Howard. Tom, Joyce, and Cully are interesting and sympathetic characters who would be welcome in most communities; the kind of people you might like to have living next door.This season is followed by season 13 (there are a total of 15 seasons to date) in which John Nettles plays the role of DCI Tom Barnaby in the first four episodes and then \"retires.\" He is replaced by John Barnaby, Tom's cousin from Brighton, played by Neil Dudgeon. All told there have been a total of 90 episodes and 2 Christmas Specials not all of which are yet available in the United States.The series has a world-wide popularity and should appeal to all who appreciate a good British detective mystery.", "term": "Enjoyable and Well Worth Watching!", "id": "8633:1_0"}, "8634:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I love watching this show.

Anyway, back to this season of Midsomer--while there is always an occasional episode that isn't stellar throughout the history of the show, there is never one that is less than enjoyable and if you've liked most of the seasons before this one, you won't be disappointed.Midsomer has wonderful production values, amazingly well-known special guest stars, and has an elemental of humorous charm in the character of Inspector Tom Barnaby.  One of the things I most like about all of the Midsomer seasons is that I can rewatch them and feel like I am surrounded by intelligent and comforting friends.  The complexity of characters and the motives that drive the murders always leaves me feeling like I enjoyed it as much the second or third time.  And the feel-good ending of each and every episode is the final piece of magic that Midsomer brings to its viewers.", "term": "Another excellent season of Midsomer!", "id": "8635:1_0"}, "8636:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Midsomer Murders is a fine example of British cozy mysteries (inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham), without going over the top on the gore factor. Set in the bucolic English villages in Midsomer County, the murders that occur here(at an alarmingly high rate, one might add) are in stark contrast to the serene beauty of the English countryside. The murders can be grisly, but this is often offset by the scenic country setting, and the witty dialogue (FYI - Amazon Prime members are able to view Midsomer Murders' episodes Seasons 1-10 via instant download for free).DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) leads a relatively contented life with his wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) and works for the Criminal Investigation Department. Assisted by his detective sergeant, the pair find themselves going all over the county investigating the strangest and at times grisliest murders in little hamlets with innocent sounding names. Tom is a meticulous investigator and an astute observer of human nature. His methodical investigative methods and keen eye contrast with his Detective Sergeants (over the course of the series, several actors portray Tom's DS), who are typically wet behind the ear, and prone to arriving at erroneous conclusions.The episodes in Season 12 are:The Dogleg MurdersThe Black BookSecrets and SpiesThe GlitchThere is a Gothic feel to many of the crimes, which is enhanced by the unique music chosen to accompany a particular episode. At times, certain scenes seem overly exaggerated, but to me, they only add to the charm of the show. This is a great example of atmospheric crime dramas with a wonderful ensemble cast and riveting storylines. Midsomer Murders will appeal to fans of British cozy mysteries, where blood and gore take a backseat to wit and humor, and the focus is on investigations set amidst a bucolic, close-knit setting.", "term": "One of the best in British cozy mysteries", "id": "8636:1_0"}, "8637:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Victorious is a great show for anyone, my daughter is a huge fan of victoria justice and I have to admit watching this show so am i now, plus the cast is very talented.", "term": "Great Show!!!", "id": "8637:1_0"}, "8638:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "In 2010, from the executive producer of \"Drake & Josh\", \"iCarly\", \"Kenan & Kel\" and \"Zoey 101' came a new Nickelodeon series titled \"Victorious\", starring actress/singer Victoria Justice (known for her role as Lola Martinez on \"Zoey 101') as Victoria \"Tori\" Vega.\"Victorious\" focuses on Victoria \"Tori\" who has been accepted at Hollywood Arts High School, after taking her sister Trina's (played by Daniella Monet) place in a showcase. While Trina is known more for her drive to become an actress, her sister \"Tori\" has talent that she is not too conscious about and now trying to fit in her new school.With the DVD release of \"Victorious: Season Two\", included are 12 episodes featuring Tori Vega as she continues to embrace her musical and acting talent at Hollywood Arts High School.

The series is shot via Digital and the picture quality is very good on DVD. I didn't notice any major artifacting or digital noise. But for the most part, fans should be pleased with the video and audio.There are no subtitles but closed captions are included.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Victorious: The Complete Second Season\" comes with the following special features:JUDGMENT CALL:\"Seven Secrets\" with Victoria Justice - (22:40) Learn more about the actress who plays Tori Vega on \"Victorious\".  Victoria Justice talks about coming from Hollywood, Florida to Hollywood, California and having her own show.  Many more fun facts about the actress!Behind The Scenes - (:54) Behind-the-scenes of the cast of the \"Victorious\" two-episode special \"Locked Up\".A fun and entertaining series, the second season of \"Victorious\" has definitely improved since the first season and actress Victoria Justice continues to shine!When I saw Victoria Justice appearing on \"iCarly\" last year, I had the feeling that Nickelodeon or even Dan Schneider was planning to use the actress for a new show and I was right. Victoria Justice who had starred on \"Zoey 101' and had short roles in various Schneider-related series has her chance to not just showcase her acting but also singing.And here we are with \"Victorious\" season two.  The cast has since gotten better with their chemistry and Victoria Justice is much more confident playing the lead character and more comfortable in her performance this time around.The episodes are still fun, silly and enjoyable.  I do enjoy the way the writers integrate the characters in each episode and for the most part, the writing has gotten better.  For the majority of this season, \"Victorious\" focuses a lot on Victoria Justice taking on a variety of roles.  May it be a singer, a prom coordinator, writing her own play, making her own music, there was definitely a great utilization of the lead actress, while the supporting cast also have plenty of scenes as well.As for parents who are wondering if this is fine for children, for older children, I can say yes as there is no scenes that caused me to rethink of having my own son watching the series. But the series does focus on teenagers and it's a teen-driven comedy series. I didn't see any violence but kids who like to mimic what they say on TV, it's up to parent if they feel that the show is appropriate.There are some questionable scenes that parents may object to.  One features Cat Valentine accidentally receiving emergency calls on her cell phone and in her naive way, she loves the attention from the calls but doesn't really call 911 to get them help.  Another scene that parents may not want their children to watch is \"Tori Gets Struck\" which features Tori donating blood and when Robbie accidentally drops the bag, the blood explodes on both characters.  Definitely something that may freak out younger viewers.But I personally didn't find anything wrong with older children watching \"Victorious\" and they may enjoy the music especially the comedy presented in the series. For the most part, these episodes are safe and are intended for young teens or older children.And as for the series, this is not a musical show in the sense of shows like \"Glee\".  It's a different type of series that takes on teen issues, friendships and wacky situations.  The show is primarily about Tori Vega and while others may display their musical or acting chops, its a series about Tori and friends. No one breaks out in song or dance unless the situation calls for it but if anyone is doing any singing, it's Tori Vega and sometimes her very crazy sister Trina.I found the series to be fun and wacky at times. You have the teen drama, the teen angst and crazy moments, especially when it features ventriloquist Robbie Shapiro and his bad attitude dummy, the spaced out Cat Valentine or Tori's bratty older sister Trina.  I did notice that this second season featured less of Beck Oliver and shorter appearances by Tori's sister Trina and the episodes tend to focus on storylines that revolve around Tori, Andre, Jade, Robbie and Cat.As \"Victorious\" is on its third season, it's important to note that this is the complete second season of \"Victorious\" (whereas the first season was released in two DVD volumes).Overall, \"Victorious\" is a fun and enjoyable series and with the second season, the episodes continue its fun, crazy hijinks and good music. Victoria Justice has really developed to be a pretty solid actress with a solid voice.  So, I pretty much like how her character has been developed in these last two seasons.  Also, with the other characters itself, although I felt the writers are playing the naivety of Cat Valentine a bit too much and when there are no laughs but silence, it seems quite a bit awkward.  But the acting is much better for this second season, especially as the talent are now settled in.If you are a fan of \"Victorious\", this DVD of \"Victorious: The Complete Second Season\" is recommended!", "term": "Another season of enjoyable, fun and crazy episodes of \"Victorious\"!", "id": "8638:1_0"}, "8639:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It's just like watching in an HD screen.

But I will admit, if you watch enough of those shows, you might start to believe that everyone is either a killer or will be killed.  It's just a matter of time.Luckily I haven't quite come to that conclusion quite yet myself, but I tend to be somewhat selective about what I watch.  I used to work an all-night shift in a grocery store as a night crew manager, and I learned early on the following immutable fact:  you should never turn your back on someone that you don't know.  Bad things can happen, particularly at 3AM.  A lot of people say, \"Watch your back.\"  I say, \"Keep your back always to the wall, especially when you're in a dangerous location.\"And bad things happen on this show at all hours of the day, especially at night.  I've only watched one episode so far -- and the beginning of another -- but so far, I really like this show.  It is very understated; most cop shows, such as \"The Following,\" show officers running around with their heads cut off like over-caffeinated chickens.  And don't forget the donuts.  But not here.  The officers in this show take their time, talk about what may or may not be happening, and only take action when that action is warranted.  I believe that this is how most cops probably behave in real life; if they didn't they wouldn't be cops, or alive, for long.I lived in Seattle for about 30 years -- or about 30 years too long -- and so that drew me in a bit.  It's nice to see the old sites and all the rain, albeit from afar.  And it does seem that there are more killers per capita in Seattle, particularly serial killers, than almost anywhere else, so I think that the location for the series was a wise choice.Well, gotta go.

Imagine my surprise then to hear that viewers were in an uproar when it finished this week because there is a cliffhanger instead of a resolution plus (evidently) the murderer in the American version is not going to be the same person as in the Danish original. I was amazed because the Danish one could not have ended in a more clear cut and logical fashion.  The murder was solved.  The murderer was someone quite logical and a \"person of interest\" throughout to the investigators.  My recommendation is now to go find the Danish one, which is excellent.  It is too bad that the Americans didn't just keep reproducing it frame for frame, the way they started out.This is an American remake of a Danish tv series of the same name.  I have seen the entire Danish tv series.  This is a very faithful and well done recreation of the series yet changes it to English language and Seattle rather than Copenhagen.  There are some fairly minor differences so far between the two scripts. For example, the lead detective, a woman, has a real battleaxe of a mother staying with her in the Danish version as she's getting ready for her second marriage in three weeks time.  She has been eliminated in the American version but she is the only character to be eliminated.  Since I found the mother very annoying, I don't see that as a flaw.  Some other slight differences: her underling male detective in the American version is not hostile to her like he is in the Danish one. In fact, they seem to get along; the male politician in Copenhagen is a lot more complex character than he is in Seattle but that may be because Copenhagen politics are downright baffling.  Otherwise we are pretty much right on point scene for scene right down to the music for the show. My original review follows.The action for the two detectives is discovering a 17 year old girl who has been murdered.  She was discovered in the trunk of a car in a lake.  She was put in the trunk alive and took about ten minutes to die once underwater.  The detectives are up close and personal with the family and the family goes completely to pieces (in both versions). The car was owned by the male politician's political campaign and it was he and his workers who used that car. The girl was supposedly with a female classmate for the last three days but it turns out that she hadn't been.  No one knows where she was after the school Halloween dance. The first suspect interviewed is her last boyfriend, a spoiled rich kid  The detectives will continue combing through everyone and everything.  The quiet doggedness of the woman detective is what really stands out in the series and she is in almost every frame of the show.", "term": "Promising--Faithful to Danish Original Version", "id": "8684:1_0"}, "8685:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "GREAT writing, EXCELLENT acting and TREMENDOUS videography considering Seattle's crappy, rainy weather!!!!", "term": "Five Stars", "id": "8685:1_0"}, "8686:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Season 1 and 2 of &#34;The Killing&#34; is the best crime thriller since the original &#34;Fugitive&#34;.

Unlike shows such as CSI, the detectives in particular don't always make the best choices, work on imperfect information and struggle with their own personal issues as much as the case at hand.As the audience starts to uncover more about the suspects and different people who may or may not be involved in the killing, we see the messiness of people's lives, the hidden activities just under the surface and the not-so-obvious motivations at work.What's particularly refreshing about the format is that a single case is investigated over the entire season.

I, personally, look at the show as the thematic cousin to \"Twin Peaks\" albeit with a completely different tone and vibe.  Both shows center around the murder of a girl, both even feature the tagline \"Who Killed.....(Rosie Larsen and Laura Palmer, respectively),\" and both chart three similar storylines.  We see the investigation progress, we see the painful aftermath on the girl's family and friends, and we see how the murder may be tied to local politicians and bigwigs.  That, of course, is where the similarities cease.  \"The Killing\" is a deadly serious and contemplative drama set in Seattle--not at all encumbered with the quirky eccentricities that defined that other Washington State township.  It is an intense and quiet show with a slow build--those eager for easy answers and constant action may need to look elsewhere.  The pace of \"The Killing\" is more akin to the unraveling of a fine novel.Through successive episodes, the path to identifying the murderer becomes increasingly muddy.  Steely and determined Mireille Enos play the intrepid lead investigator haunted by past mistakes.  She is unable to move on with her own life and, in fact, sacrifices potential happiness in her dogged pursuit of justice.  Her replacement (only he can't replace her when she won't leave!) is the offbeat Joel Kinnaman.  Both humorous and strangely intense, the two forge an uneasy relationship that provides a lot of conflict, drama, and unexpected laughs.  On another front, the always terrific Michelle Forbes and Brendan Sexton III play the deceased girl's parents.  Forbes is magnetic going through the stages of grief and Sexton is a powder keg of repressed emotion.  And lastly, there is the political component that weaves around the central mystery in surprising ways.  Billy Campbell plays a mayoral candidate whose closeness to the investigation causes some major issues on the campaign trail.Of course, this brief synopsis really does no justice to the intricacies of the actual story--but serves as a simple introduction.  Every episode is structured as one day in the investigation, but the show really does a fine job balancing the three concurrent plot components.  Well written and intelligent, the show is not your typical police procedural.  This one relies on in-depth characterizations and complex plotting.  Again, if you are looking for light hearted or breezy fare--this would not be it.  This requires and rewards patience and attention--and that's something I appreciate in the land of formulaic television.Check this out as a slow burn mystery.  I especially recommend it for the performances.  While everyone is quite good, I have to single out Forbes and Sexton.  Forbes puts it all onto the line in raw naked emotion--I can't think of a recent TV performance quite so harrowing.  And Sexton is more understated, complex, and internal--but no less effective or believable.  Great job to them.  An intriguing show for adults, if that sounds like a recommendation--it certainly is.

They have meaning and, on top of that, they have things that say something to the viewer. They also have something in them that goes deeper than death. You see the impact and the grief, and you see the people that are after the people who did this. It would be easy to dismiss parts of it but, in a good show, it all counts. Then this show leads to the Cage, where a lot of the stuff takes on a shape.If you have yet to watch, you are missing out.

I think the reviewers who described it that way were right.  It is set around the murder of a teenage girl named Rosie Larson, and the story shifts between the police detectives investigating the murder, the fallout of the murder on the remaining family members, and the mayoral campaign between the incumbent mayor and a city council member who may or may not be involved in the murder.  There is a ton of misdirection when it comes to who is and is not a suspect, and people that you are made to think are involved are very much red herrings.  In the beginning there are a lot of characters to keep track of, which is not hard but does get a little tricky when the story keeps jumping around.  By the end of the season however, the main players are pretty firmly entrenched.Most of the episodes revolve around the murder investigation, but there is a lot of time devoted to building the back stories for the detectives Linden and Holder, and councilman Richmand.  In fact, those who have stuck with the series will know that the framework for the story that was told in season 3 was planted in a couple episodes of season 1.  The show does a great job of portraying both Linden and Holder as having very flawed personal lives (Linden's involving her relationship with her teenage son and fiance, and Holder with a history of meth use), but dedicated to solving the murder.Even with the story jumping around the show devotes a lot of time to all of the characters and arcs, and does a good job interweaving the side stories with the main one.  All of the actors do a great job, and because there is no big star in the cast (everyone is either unknown or has had supporting roles in other shows) all the characters and stories get sufficient time to build up and play out.  This is definitely a show that you have to be patient with because nothing is revealed all at once, and when there is a reveal it is often times a misdirection.  The season ends with a tease of catching the killer, but ultimately ends on a cliff hanger.As far as extras go there is a behind the scenes feature which features interviews with the cast and show runners, some deleted scenes, a gag reel and commentary on certain episodes.

Once you consider this season together with season 2, the logic in the story line and the connection between all the different events is truly impeccable.There are some gut-wrenching moments, which start but do not end, with the discovery of a murdered teenager, Rosie Larsen. We get to see first hand how the events affect the family. But the personal impact from the crime does not stop there, since Sarah Linden, a detective that was leaving Seattle to get married the day the body was discovered cannot seem to let the case go and becomes obsessed with it. This in turns put some stress on her personal relationships, not only with her fiance, but also with her teenager son. The personal stories of the main characters are paramount to making this series what it is, from Linden and her new partner, to politicians and aides, all have something interesting to add to the mix.I am in the process of finishing watching season 2 and that one is just as good.

That is besides the point though, my job is review the content and what I saw was very different. The Killing actually took some time to grow on me. It is everything that's advertised, but it's a bit unusual. Rosie Larsen is a seemingly innocent seventeen year old girl, whose body is found inside the trunk of a car, belonging to the campaign of a Mayoral candidate. After the premier episode that introduces us to everyone, the following episodes are broken up into segments. One closely follow every aspect of the police investigation, which is really fascinating. It's also somewhat strange as the two detectives are both in their twenties. Linden (Mireille Enos) has a past, is extremely dedicated to he job, and seemingly has no emotion. Her partner Holder (Joel Kinnaman) is young, good looking, and may have called in some favors to get the job he has. Holder is short tempered and immature, the perfect opposite of Linden, making them a very interesting pair. The next set of segments follows the Mayoral race, we get to deeply know both candidates, their campaigns, and the people who work for them, giving us an unlimited number of suspects. The last of the regular segments, features the heartbroken family of Rosie Larsen and in detail it shows how it effects each member. The story being told is one of the best I've ever seen in a TV show. No one is what they seem, everyone is a suspect, and their are so many twists and turns that you'll be doubting yourself as much as the investigators doubt their instincts. The cast is equally as good and in fact is what makes this show unique. The characters are not the type of characters you'd expect to see in this type of show. The personalities don't quite fit the roles and it leads to some very unusual, but interesting scenes.

They think they see it, too, but things are always more complex than they first appear. Such is life, even looking into demise. The campaign trail is also a hotspot, with a mayor now defending himself against allegations brought up in the last episode. This leads to power shifting, consolidations, and to a basketball game with stakes - and conversation - that is complex and grand.

I know they all lay a groundwork but, sometimes, they do more than that. this is one of those where you see the manifestations of the past, and where you feel for the characters all-the-more. Tagging along with the family has been a lot of things, for example, with grief and pain showing just as much as the anger and the hate. This leads down roads, and those roads make you wonder just want action you might consider.

Just as we probably wouldn't do. They still make us tear up. Takashi Miike's 13 Assassins owes much to the story of the 47 ronin. The story still works, whether it's the 47 ronin, those seven samurai or Robert Taylor and his 13 buddies on Bataan.Look upon 13 Assassins as a movie with four acts, set in Japan in the middle of the 19th century. The Tokugawa shogunate is decaying, falling apart because of outdated customs, calcified hereditary government, corruption and too many armed warriors with sharp swords and nothing much to do after nearly three centuries of peace. There's a weak, disengaged shogun; his ambitious, cruel and probably psychopathic younger half brother who pushes the envelope when it comes to other men's wives and his own servants, who soon will move into a position of power; a samurai of honor and bravery who is recruited to end the young man's career permanently; the 12 men he recruits to assist him; and how it all ends. No love stories, no sex.Act one: We see what a monster Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu is. For an attractive-looking and privileged young man, even Jack the Ripper might find off-putting his ways of relaxing through rape and murder. He gives sadism a bad name.Act two: We meet Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho), an experienced, tired and trusted samurai. We follow how he is recruited by those high in the government, how he recruits 11 others (along the way a mountain peasant will join them), and how he sets his traps to attack the young psycho as Naritsugu and his warriors travel from Edo to Naritsugu's clan province.Act three: A 50-minute battle that leaves just about everyone in sight slashed, burned or exploded to death.Act four: A better world...maybe.Yes, the story is a clich&eacute;. Miike, however, has delivered a movie of excellent craftsmanship. He immediately sets the point of the movie with a scene of queasy but not gory seppuku, and develops why this act leads to the assassination plot. For the most part, the 13 assassins are well-defined enough that the audience is drawn to them, and is saddened at their inevitable and noble deaths. Miike presents a vision of feudal Japan, its leadership, the county and its life that is realistic as well as beautifully photographed. The action may be brutal but the views are first-rate. He handles the long, climactic battle with mastery. This action is set in the village of Ochiai, a village of death Shinzaemon calls it, where he and his 12 fellows meet head on Matsudaira and his 200 retainers, considerably more than they expected. Shinzaemon and his men have laced the village with deathly, unexpected traps that surprise the opposing samurai as much as they surprise the audience. It's 50 minutes of rousing sword-slashing action, the few against the many, with each assassin having his moment of bravery while he cuts down or blows up dozens.  Miike hurtles the action along and he is skilled enough not to lose the clarity of how the long battle proceeds.Two quibbles, one serious. Whoever wrote the subtitles did a disservice to the movie by using American vernacular far too often. Informal phrases that we wouldn't notice in a contemporary American film are jarring when supposedly coming from the mouths of samurai in the 1840s. \"Listen up\" is only one of several examples.At the end we're also faced with the question, is one of the 13 a ghost or simply a hardy survivor of a sword thrust through the neck and abdomen? Miike says it could be either, and either way a viewer might take it is fine with him. I feel it's either sloppy or pretentious directing, bringing in an unneeded question at the end of a very good movie.For those who admire and have enjoyed this movie, I recommend they watch Chushingura (1962), a nearly 3-1/2 hour telling of the story of the 47 ronin.The DVD of 13 Assassins includes an interview with Miike by a constantly smiling and deferential young woman who lobs easy questions. Miike at one point says, \"This is not an action film, but a drama.\" He's right. For all the action, the movie has a pervasive feeling of something like sadness and inevitability. But later Miike says, \"When a sword hits another sword, it's not about metal hitting against metal. It's someone's soul battling another soul.\" Shades of Mishima. The truth probably lies among Lord Matsudaira's last words. As he says, \"It hurts.\"", "term": "\"Some call it elegance. Some call it cruel.

The important thing in a film like this is that there be a minimum of exposition and a maximum of sword play and daring do, and that the quality of the battles be exquisite.It's hard to view a film like this without thinking of Kurosawa's Samurai films and, of course, Toshiro Mifune (1920-97), who played a central role in many of Kurosawa's best films. Mifune made 16 films with Kurosawa (\"Seven Samurai\", Yojimbo\", \"Sanjuro\") and without Kurosawa made the \"Samurai Trilogy\" with Hirtoshi Inagki.Koji Yakusho (1956) has the main role. Yakusho has been in nearly 100 films and is a favorite of director Kiyoshi Kurosawa (\"Memoirs of a Geisha\", \"Babel\") who is not related to Akira Kurosawa.The film is directed by Takashi Miike (1960) who is known for the extreme violence in his dozen plus films (\"Triad Society\", \"Dead or Alive\", \"Ichi the Killer\").

It's hard to keep track of who is dying, and with 13 Assassins instead of 7 Samurai, the impact of the death of each is substantially lessened.Miike has also failed to draw out his characters in three dimensions, undoubtedly due to the number, and so the combat and the death are less dramatic.

I couldn't wait to see it. As it turns out I could have.The comparisons to Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' are inescapable, and this just isn't as good. In 'Seven Samura1' you have a group of Samurai protecting a farming village from bandits. In this movie you have a group of Samurai who need to assassinate a demented Shogun to stop Japan from declining into an endless cycle of war. 'Seven Samurai' runs 3 hours and 17 min. (depending on which version you see) and time is taken to allow the viewer to meet the principal characters and set up the story. '13 Assassins' runs at 2 hours and 5 min. so you only get to meet a small handful of the guys for whom you are supposed to build up sympathy. They do a decent enough job setting up the story but it's peopled mostly with a faceless group of samurai. And their clothing and hair cuts were so similar it took me way too long to sort them out. The one fellow they take on as a guide and the 13th member, who easily stands in for the Mifune character in 'Seven Samurai', is the only face you could pick out of a crowd.Also, these assassins are well funded. They literally buy an entire town away from its inhabitants, with gold, to stage the big battle.

Some of the 'tricks' they use to help even the odds (13 against 200) don't ring true. They are too \"now.\" The actual sword fighting scenes are good but they're really not more than a lot of hacking. You don't really get to see a difference in the level of skill between the two factions. So why the huge difference in the kill ratio? It's like in a lot of American action movies where the good guys can shoot a fly off an apple at 50 yards and the bad guys can't hit doodly squat.This is not a bad movie by any means.

If you're down with archetypes, what's more archetypal than the steadfast samurai? So there's that ingredient very much in the mix, but then Miike gives it a twist. A subtle running theme involves the steadfast samurai conflicted between his loyalty to his corrupt lord and the knowledge that his lord's depravity will certainly destroy the realm should he ascend to greater power. No wonder the samurai are stoic mothers.Set in 1844, near the end of Japan's feudal era, the story makes known to us the Shogun's younger half-brother, the sadistidc Lord Naritsugu (Goro Inagaki), whose despicable deeds have damned him in the eyes of Sir Doi, a senior advisor in the Shogun's council. Except that protocol must be observed. Lord Naritsugu cannot be removed from his office without compromising the shogun system. And so Sir Doi enlists to his cause the crafty and patient samurai and widower Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho, whom I freakin' loved in SHALL WE DANCE?). Shinzaemon listens to Sir Doi's pitch and then reflects: \"How fate smiles on me. As a samurai in this era of peace I've been wishing for a noble death.\" He quietly goes about his recruitment drive, eventually gathering eleven other likeminded warriors. Plus a peasant from the hills who relishes a good scrap. Thirteen assassins.I don't know that Miike covers anything new in the samurai genre. In fact, I'm fairly certain he doesn't. What makes his movie so very good is the solid storytelling and the sheer style he infuses into the thing. It helps that Miike is able to so vividly demonstrate Lord Naritsugu's vileness and his utter contempt for those inferior to his rank. The lord's acts of brutality recall the disturbing vibe so prevalent in Miike's AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER. You watch Lord Naritsugu and you can't help but wish a world of hurt on him. The thirteen assassins' cause is a righteous cause. Shinzaemon Shimada ensures that his killing crew is prepared to sacrifice their lives if need be. He tells them, \"He who values his life dies a dog's death,\" and I'll be using that phrase next time my buddies try to bluff me at the card table. But off they go, Shinzaemon and his crew, thirteen going up against more than two hundred of Naritsugu's bodyguards.Miike takes his time setting the stage and introducing the characters, and so you may start thinking that the narrative is plodding. But the first hour rewards you. It lends depth; it enriches the story. In fact, I wish the story had developed more of the thirteen assassins so that some of their deaths later on would mean more. There are only four or five characters in whom I was truly invested. And, yes, that unruly hillsman Koyata (Yusuke Iseya) - who gleefully fights with rocks in a sling and whatever else he can get his hands on - is one of them.The last fifty minutes are crazy bananas! Miike's sense of bravura is on full display as we eyeball the extended, extremely bloody final battle. How could thirteen men stand up to over two hundred fighters? You would have to pick the site of the battle (in this instance, an abandoned town). And you would have to stage a maze of boobytraps. And, even then, odds are, it's still a suicide mission. Takashi Miike unloads a series of intense, harrowing action sequences that detail the ugliness and futility and sheer chaos of war. Shinzaemon Shimada was not messing around when, in the calm before the storm, he displays to the enemy a raggedy banner on which is scribbled \"Total massacre!\"Thirteen against over two hundred - let's not kid ourselves. Not everyone makes it out alive. Most everyone, in fact, perishes. The thirteen assassins may be elite samurai but fatigue and overwhelming numbers will exact their toll, and they fall one by one. I like to think that Akira Kurosawa would've enjoyed the hell out of this film. Certainly there are echoes here of THE SEVEN SAMURAI. Kurosawa would've been down with Miike's message. He would've approved of Shinzaemon Shimada but approved even more of Koyata, the feral man from the hills. \"Do only samurai matter in this world?\" Koyata rages at one juncture. But then he also whoops to his fellow fighters: \"Your samurai brawls are crazy fun!\" Miike leaves Koyata subject to interpretation, and I only mention this because some folks have ranted on about how unrealistic it is that Koyata is able to survive some of his nastier wounds. You could put that down to his being a very tough bloke. But there are clues peppered in the film that may suggest Koyata isn't human at all - and, if so, there goes that hard-fought sense of realism. Either way, Koyata - and Lord Naritsugu, come to think of it - fits into Takashi Miike's wild aesthetics more so than anyone else in this picture.The DVD's bonus stuff: tons of deleted scenes (00:18:13 minutes long, with English sub-titles); an interview with Takashi Miike in which he, while flashing a sly grin, invites everyone to bring their grandma and grandkids to the movie (00:18:40 minutes long, with English sub-titles); and the theatrical trailer.", "term": "\"He who values his life dies a dog's death.\"", "id": "8747:1_0"}, "8748:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "This is a story about a bunch of samurai warriors who are about to be past by in time into the modern era.

It's a well-filmed, well-acted samurai movie (with more than a few nods to 'Seven Samurai') and despite this DVD being 15-20 minutes shorter than the original cut it's still a knock-out!The story of '13 Assassins' is centered around a young lord named Naritsugu (a reserved, yet frightening Goro Inagaki). Naritsugu rapes and butchers for fun and thanks to his older brother being Shogun is untouchable by law. Shinzaemon (an excellent Koji Yakusho) is a noble samurai tasked with assassinating Naritsugu before he gains even more political power. Shinazaemon rounds up a small group of warriors (including his reluctant nephew) and stages an ambush for Naritsugu and the hundreds of soldiers under his command.The plot of '13 Assassins' is very straight-forward with the focus more on the gathering of the 13 warriors and their planned ambush and lesser focus on character development. Normally this would make a reasonably shallow film but the characters we DO get to know are engaging and the final battle (lasting almost an hour) is one of the best filmed melee's I've ever seen! There are some disturbing moments towards the beginning of the film but overall the violence and gore is more restrained than I'd expect from director Takashi Miike.This DVD transfer of '13 Assassins' compliments the movie's camera work and use of color perfectly. There are some moments of CGI in the film that are painfully obvious on the small screen DVD, but they are minor. The DVD disc also comes with some of the deleted scenes from the original cut of '13 Assassins' that flesh out more of the story and characters (especially Koyata and Shinrouko).

For this first half of this film, it felt pretty slow with only a couple of action scenes that felt a bit too quick, though I guess I can let it slide with the disturbing image of a young woman with limbs severed off (I got to hand it to him, Takashi refuses to follow any cinematic rules, and this film furthers his stuff). The meatier violence, sadly, is closer to the end, just in the second half of the flick. And, just like in movie Detective Story, there's a shocking image of a nude boy... though he actually takes a leak, getting a lead samurai to smile in incredulity of the simplicity of small village life. But when the action does start, it's heavy hitting, nonstop, and completely jaw-dropping. Out of all the assassins, I'm inclined to like the last added one since he's quite the riot with his clumsiness and big mouth. The very last action scene seemed to also have the best philosophy in the movie, since it deals with the integrity and diginity of all man, including one's own enemy and reveals the total nonchalance and inhumanity of the main enemy in the film.

But to fully appreciate the tale that 'Assassins' is crafting, you have to understand the Samurai - their machinations for power, political infrastructure and shared heritage.In this period, prior to the West's forced entry into Japan via Commodore Perry, the samurai culture had just past its zenith. Peace had ruled the land for so long that the warrior class were mostly that in name alone - few had tasted real combat. Fewer still wanted it. Luxury and prestige were often chosen above stark training and an ascetic life. And the ultimate glory, to die in battle, was considered poetic by many who carried the 'daisho' (two swords), not a literal truth as in the past.Additionally, absolute loyalty without question was honored above all else. The entire structure of governance was based on this concept, and without it, chaos would ensue.So when an unspeakably horrific monster, born into the family of the Shogunate (the warrior ruling class), was about to be promoted as the Shogun's primary advisor - it was inconceivable that the retainers would do anything to rid themselves of this human cancer; not without bringing terrible shame and dishonor to themselves and their families. And, by default, destabilizing the very structure of their existence and potentially plunging the country back into civil war.The question is, and the crux of this film, what do you do?Borrowing heavily from the true story of 'The Forty-Seven Ronin' - very special men, old school samurai if you will, would take on the task of killing this living demon in human form.Viewers have to understand that assassination of a superior was considered the penultimate evil in samurai culture. It would be akin to combining the modern crimes of betraying your country, raping your sister, and cannibalizing a small child - all wrapped up into one wholly unforgivable sin. So to choose the path of assassination... well, you can only imagine the unbelievable burden being placed on their shoulders.If you can assimilate the contradiction of finding honor in committing the dishonorable - then this film will be infinitely more powerful and enjoyable.That said, I found the film a bit formulaic. While likely 'new' to many in the west, these dramas have been a cultural mainstay for the Japanese since the first katana raised in front of movie cameras. Annual Taiga productions are clearly the standard by which to measure the story, with Kurosawa as the foundation onto which all like stories are visually expressed.Overall - enjoyable, but not superior. I would encourage viewers to invest time and funds in other productions. See Wikipedia under 'Taiga Drama\".[Edited 6.12.11] Learned something new about this production that I feel truly adds to the wonderful characterizations in this film. During the battle, the comical character whom the Twelve meet in the mountains is mortally wounded, a wakizashi thrown by the \"demon\" stabbing him in the throat. Yet, after the battle, he later appears unhurt; commenting how sad he was that the fun was over and happily trotting off back to the mountain.I had ascribed the scene as some kind of medically-explanable freak event. However, an Amazon Discussion reveals a much deeper insight into the film and Japanese culture itself.In fact, what we're witnessing is the physical embodiment of a 'Tengu' - a type of spirit or demon. It appears there are two types, falling into the basic categories of good and evil. Obviously the imp is a good version of this creature. And even more specifically, he appears to have taken the form of a 'Yamabushi' - an ascetic mountain warrior.Wikipedia cites a tale which must have been the inspiration for this character: \"According to a legend in the 18th-century Kaidan Toshiotoko, a tengu took the form of a yamabushi and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form.\"", "term": "Finding Honor In Committing The Dishonorable", "id": "8755:1_0"}, "8756:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I've always loved martial arts films, perhaps because I grew up when Bruce Lee was all the rage. Having seen him on TV in THE GREEN HORNET and then in a theater with the greatest martial arts film of all time, ENTER THE DRAGON, I was hooked. It wasn't until later that I had the chance to see a film genre similar to this, the samurai film. Made popular by director Akira Kurosawa, the films were similar in that they came from an Asian country and featured action figures prone to skilled violence. But samurai films offered something else.Instead of the usual high leaps, swinging arms and 2x4 slapping sound effects, they offered deeper stories. Two in particular caught the eyes of other directors who turned them into westerns. THE SEVEN SAMURAI was westernized into THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and YOJIMBO became A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. These then inspired people to seek out the originals and they weren't disappointed.From time to time more samurai films have been released, but rarely with the anticipation of Takashi Miike's 13 ASSASSINS. The director noted for his extreme films like AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER could have gone the usual route his films do featuring buckets of blood but instead he made a more classic samurai film and it is simply amazing.The story takes place around 1844 and revolves around a group of assassins who have determined that to save their country they must remove the heir apparent to the current Shogun. Lord Naritsugo is a cruel ruler who finds entertainment in the thing he does to his people. Be it killing a family one at a time in front of the others (including children) or slicing the limbs from a young woman, keeping her alive and then sexually abusing her when it suits him, this man feels it is his responsibility to keep his people in line by making sure they are always put in their place on the social scale.A member of the Shogun's staff knows something must be done but due to the way things are done can do nothing on his own. Instead he imposes on Shinzaemon Shimada to handle the situation for him. A samurai of the highest order, Shinzaemon knows what must be done and after seeing the after effects of what Naritsugo has done, elects to assassinate him. But it will require the help of a few trusted men to aid him.There is little action in the film at the start. Shinzaemon takes his time assembling the men who will help him. Each has a reason for accompanying him on this task be it boredom in a world where samurai have little cause to find battle or to make money. In the end, each of them follows the way of the warrior, of honor, and takes on the cause of saving their country.There is plenty of story to this film. The build up of Shinzaemon's team is part of it but there is also the political intrigue that goes on behind the scenes as well. Losing face is an important part of the way things happened then, thus Shinzaemon's being brought in to begin with. Then there is the situation that arises when it is learned that the leader of the guard protecting Naritsugo is Hanbei Kitou, an old rival who has always thought that Shinzaemon was the reason he was a step down on the social scale. These two warriors plot against one another, one on the attack the other protecting an evil man, and in the end only one can win.All the build up takes time but the payoff is amazing to see. The last 50 minutes of the film is non-stop action. Shinzaemon must stop Naritsugo from reaching the Akashi domain or all is lost. He diverts him to a town he has taken over and turned into a death trap. Expecting Naritsugo and a company of perhaps 75 men, he learns too late that there is more like 300. But that doesn't prevent him or the other 12 men from following the duty they have sworn to follow. The result is a sword swinging, blood flowing, explosive rending battle that leaves few standing by the end of the film.The thing about samurai films is that there may be blood and violence involved, but they aren't just tossed in for effect. These men truly believed in honor and a way of doing things, they did follow their conscience and stood for something. The battle with a blade was not one that involved going back and forth so much as seeking a finish with as few moves as possible. There was a beauty to it.Miike has done it again, surprising many who thought his film career had reached its high point. Instead he gives us a movie that shows there is still potential in all that he does. The acting is wonderful even if it offers little visible emotion. That was the way of the samurai, not to show fear or emotion. And yet there are subtle signs visible in the way these actors play their parts.In the end you have an amazingly satisfying film. One that tells a story, that offers plenty of action and that entertains on so many levels. 13 ASSASSINS is not a film that you'll toss aside once it finishes.

The year is 1844, when the age of the samurai in Japan was waning, and the shogunate would soon follow. The Shogun's half-brother Lord Naritsugu (Goro Inagaki) is expected to be appointed senior advisor. This causes disquiet across Japan, as Naritsugu has earned a reputation as a sadistic and capricious man, too immature for serious responsibilities. The Shogun's advisor Sir Doi (Mikijiro Hira) fears that the country will descend into war if Naritsugu's worthiness were to be disputed openly. He turns to the aging, trusted samurai Shinzaemon (Koji Yakusho) for a solution. Shinzaemon assembles a dozen samurai to assassinate Naritsugu en route to his home, but his Lordship is guarded by the fiercely loyal samurai Hanbei (Masachika Ichimura).By Takashi Miike's own admission, there are a lot of unnecessary scenes in this movie. I found the extraneous material trying in the first half. The second half of the film is dominated by a 50-minute battle scene, which, to the director and editor's credit, isn't tedious. Action sequences constitute about half of the film, though, oddly, Miike considers this a drama rather than an action movie. If you like swordplay, there is a lot of it on display here. But I don't think it works as a drama. A group of people of diverse ages and personalities are assembled to pull off a \"big job\" that seems a good deal more sophisticated than the group could manage. The characters are thinly drawn. There is a certain amount of comic relief amid the bloodshed, mostly provided by Koyata (Yusuke Iseya), an erstwhile hunter they meet in the mountains.I like \"13 Assassins\" visual style a lot. The greys, dark blues, and browns are stunning. But Miike sets a serious tone without serious plotting. A painfully obvious stock plot. Everything feels contrived. Naritsugu is so evil and maniacal that he is not believable. Shinzaemon's behavior toward him doesn't make sense. And the 200 soldiers they are to face seem endless, as if there are actually a lot more than that. I kept thinking that the 13 would run out of adversaries during the prolonged battle, but they just kept coming. Granted, \"13 Assassins\" is supposed to create an impression and glorify certain cultural icons more than it is supposed to make sense.

As you might expect, the film looks great.  Director Takashi Miike uses the camera to show great views of the mountainous Japanese landscape.  The small villages look authentic.  The sound is in both Dolby Digital HD and DTS HD so take your pick.  Both are fine but nothing special.  I was a bit surprised that for an action oriented film like this, we wouldn't get more from the surrounds.  Still, clear and focused.  Special features include deleted scenes, an interview with the director and a trailer.The film takes place in 1844 toward the end of the Japanese feudal era.  An evil...and I do mean evil...lord is about to ascend to power.  While he is despised by nearly everyone including his closest protectors, it is the way of life to serve the master class.  A small group of samurai are called upon to kill him.  The leader of the samurai is Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho).  He is reluctant to mutiny until he hears and sees evidence for himself.  In a ghastly scene, a nude teenage girl is presented to him.  Her limbs had been severed and her tongue cut out by the evil butcher.  Shinzaemon accepts the assignment.The first half of the film deals with the gathering of samurai warriors and their preparation to intercept the evil Lord Naritsugu as he travels to accept his Shogun promotion.  The small group of 12 encounters the 13th assassin in the forest, a peasant who is adept at stealth movement and with the use of a slingshot. He joins the band.  They are a mixture of seasoned samurai looking for one last fight and young men looking for acceptance.  While the photography is beautiful and the acting is fine, this is pretty standard stuff.  What comes next isn't.Expecting to encounter an army of about 70 soldiers guarding the lord, it turns out to be more like 200 as the lord has called in reinforcements.  In a calculated retreat, the samurai build up a ramshackle village they come across, setting numerous traps as they await the onslaught of the lord and his loyalists.  Once the battle begins it goes on for 45 minutes or so which must be some kind of record for a film.  This is not kung fu fighting or aerial ballet.  This is visceral, samurai sword fighting.  It is brutal but artistic, violent but resplendent and smartly choreographed.  We're talking about scores of combatants going at it and it all looks seamless.  The 13 extend the battle, not only because of their fearlessness and expert swordsmanship but because they had set traps to encapture the enemy in smaller groups.  This remake of Eiichi Kudo's 1963 film starts out a bit slow and predictable, but ends with one of the great hand-to-hand combat movies around.", "term": "3 1/2 stars for a brutal combat film", "id": "8761:1_0"}, "8762:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It's an obvious 7 Samarai remake but it was still pretty good.

Huh?  Ch&#363;shingura is a 47 Ronin movie. This is clearly a 'Seven Samurai' type movie.But it - in an effort to bigger and better than the original - has almost twice as many samurai. And that's a problem.Movies follow certain conventions. For example almost all movies are about two hours long. There are no thee minute movies released as feature films in theaters and there are no 37 hour movies. Experience has shown that audiences will sit for an hour and a half or two hours. Less than that and they feel cheated. More than that and their backsides go numb.We also have a convention that the star's name goes above the title in the opening credits. Then we list the players for the major roles and finally the supporting players.A movie plot normally will have about five major parts. These are the characters who get enough screen time that the audience can remember who they are. There will often be a dozen minor characters whom we usually won't recognize at first or remember afterwards.This is obviously a problem with a movie like 'Seven Samurai' or it's American spinoff 'The Magnificent Seven'.  There are too many characters for a two hour (or three hour) movie. For example in 'The Magnificent Seven'. Brynner and McQueen are the stars. Wallach is the villain. So we really only have room for a couple more. Bucholtz is the young lover so he gets some screen time.  But the other of the seven are really only sketched in. There are just too many of them. It is a tribute to the director that we can remember any of them like Brad Dexter or James Coburn. They are each only on screen for only seconds.It is worse however when you move from seven samurai to thirteen. Much worse. There is still only room for about five real characters so most of the 13 assassins are just faceless troops.This is a mature samurai movie. The bad samurai movies - or &#34;chop 'em ups&#34; - have a lot of sword play from the beginning and usually some fantastic elements. These are junk cinema. But '13 Assassins' follows the other path. There is at first little action. The characters sit in paper walled rooms knelling in front of each other and bowing a lot. They discuss duty, obligations, honor and clan relationships. The plot is about how one of them is caught in an impossible dilemma. Then typically the aggrieved party explodes in violence in the final reel. I love these kind of movies.Most samurai films are from the period of the Tokogawa Shogunate. This one is at the very end just before the Meijii Restoration.

The first half of this film is beautifully shot, acted and executed. It's textures and wonderful, and the production values are top notch. Yes once the hour long battle begins it never goes in the direction of something like Kill Bill or Shogun Assassin with spraying blood, gore and body parts.

Despite this, he managed to labor in relative obscurity in his home country for almost a decade before exploding onto the international scene with &lt;em>Audition&lt;/em> in 1999. He experienced a brief period of worldwide notoriety, releasing such smashes as &lt;em>Visitor Q&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Ichi the Killer&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>The Happiness of the Katakuris&lt;/em> before slipping back into obscurity. Why this happened, the world will likely never know, but it was only a matter of time before they took notice again. Another decade later and &lt;em> Jsan-nin no Shikaku&lt;/em>, released in English-speaking countries as &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em>, kicked off a second, and hopefully more enduring, wave of Miike-love in the west. &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em> is a film from Miike's growing obsession with the historical-drama subgenre, in which he has quietly built up a reputation for releasing fantastic movies that never received the media coverage of his bigger, showier releases.Plot: Lord Naritsugu (&lt;em>Saimin&lt;/em>'s Gor Inagaki) is next in line for the Shogunate. No one, including the existing members of the Shogunate, want him to actually take a seat. So when a member dies and Lord Naritsugu begins his journey from Edo, thirteen assasins are hired to stop him. The first half-and-change of the film is the assassins training to form a coherent unit, with us getting to know them, as well as Hanbei (Masachika Ichimura, who has since become a Miike regular), Naritsugu's personal bodyguard and the assassins' chief opposition, and Naritsugu himself. (Naritsugu is a bad guy. And I mean a &lt;em>bad&lt;/em> guy, one so bad only Hanbei's honor stops him from deserting Naritsugu once he realizes what a morally bankrupt morass of evil this guy is.) Then comes the climactic battle, which most people characterize as the second half of the film. I timed it; it's actually forty-seven minutes. There's a coda afterwards that ties everything up in semi-satisfactory fashion (as long as you're at least passing familiar with certain aspects of Japanese mythology). But the second half of the movie is definitely focused on the forty-seven minutes of stunning choreography, brilliant atmosphere, and unrestrained violence of that final fight scene.Miike's remake of a 1963 period piece (of the same name, directed by Echi Kudo) is faithful, from what I have read of the original, which is still somewhat hard to come by, but it also draws pretty heavily from &lt;em>Seven Samurai&lt;/em>. At no point, however, can this be mistaken for anything but a Miike film, as is true with all of Miike's best work. And this certainly qualifies as some of Miike's best work; the first half is quiet and tense, the second absolute chaos, and they show a director with an ability to work just as easily in both while creating the proper atmosphere for each. Not an easy task. (Note how the lighting suddenly gets really, really gloomy, after a gradual fade throughout the film, as the assassins are preparing the ambush, for example.) There are those little touches of Miike wackiness, though some of them take, shall we say, a darker turn (the incident that causes the assassins to be hired, when its aftermath is finally depicted, is the hardest scene it's been to watch for me in a Miike film since the final fifteen minutes of &lt;em>Audition&lt;/em>), there's the usual we're-not-QUITE-overacting-but-we're-really-enjoying-dancing-on-that-line, there's Miike's ever-honed sense of pace. In short, it's Takashi Miike. Short of someone who can't stomach violence, I can't imagine anyone not liking this, just as I can't imagine anyone not liking &lt;em>Sabu&lt;/em> or &lt;em>Ley Lines&lt;/em> or &lt;em>The Bird People in China&lt;/em>.

Pancevo is reputed to be the most toxic city in all of Europe. Legendary Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes (Ken Foree) and rookie agent Mina Milius (Kristina Klebe) are the principals in overseeing a prisoner transfer of which route will take them to Belgrave and then London. Did your eyes roll, like mine did, when Reyes reassured a nervous Mina: \"If ever there was an easy assignment, this is it.\" Oboy.But before they get to easy street, they have to pass thru Pancevo, just in time for that unnatural chemical leak  at the railroad track and the resulting zombie outbreak. Cornered by zombie hordes, desperate to survive, the agents join forces with their enigmatic prisoner (Emilio Roso) who seems to be more in the loop about what the ef is going on with the walking dead.Later, the group crosses paths with a sniveling reporter and a berserker soldier (fresh out the nunnery) who spouts doomsday propaganda.

I'm tempted to give this a higher rating, only because I had ba11s of fun. But I won't. This is the first ever Serbian zombie movie, so congratulations, but it's crap. The production is so low budget I suspect my 6-year-old niece was the money behind it. The acting - I'm not sure if the English was dubbed for the Serbs or if the Serbian actors spoke their lines phonetically. Theirs is some of the worst delivery of dialogue I'd ever heard. The intonations, the inflections, are weird. The body language is off. But I don't want to cut slack on the other cast members who flaunts English as their native tongue. They're also ridiculous. The entire cast is so wooden no one had better light a match. My main reason for tuning in was to watch Ken Foree, who was so badass in Romero's seminal Dawn of the Dead (and maybe the best zombie film of all time). Here - and, given, it's some thirty years later - Foree seems comparatively subdued and worn down.The gorehound elements? Are weak. The zombie make-up is passable. But there's not much in the way of authentic scares. The zombie feastings are executed so cheesily. Neither are there memorable zombie kills. What's more, the zeds can't make up their minds whether they're slow shufflers or fast, hyperactive runners.The film isn't well served by its characters making moronic decisions (given, most are there to engorge the body count). Or by that horrid shaky cam.The positives? Yes, there are some, other than the happy accident of the film's sucking so hard, it gets good. Three good things. The Serbian setting is appropriately moody. I liked the nod to Assault on Precinct 13. The prisoner here is no Napoleon Wilson but he affects some of Napoleon's cool under pressure and shaky allegiance. The other neat thing is the meta-reference to Dawn of the Dead:- Jan the d0uche reporter: \"Wait, maybe we should find some shopping mall or something.\"- Agent Reyes: \"It'd be too hard to secure. And believe me, they would get in anyway.\"Best moment in the movie.Parting observations off the top of my head (and, I guess, a SPOILERS alert):- In the midst of fleeing the zeds, folks will insist on having meaningful discussions- snapping necks shouldn't kill zombies because the brain isn't affected (but it works in this movie)- Yes, absolutely, a desk with some chairs on it shoved against the door will keep out the zeds- Until a girl has a panic attack and starts dismantling that desk and chairs because, quote, \"I need to get out!\"- Lovin' the prisoner's dramatic but absolutely unnecessary midair leap while gunning down zeds (who are still blocked by that desk)- Living legend, ex-CIA, 20-years-in-the-field, Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes needs to work on his stance when holding a firearm. Also someone needs to teach him the proper technique for holding a gun and flashlight together.- When the group encounters a bunch of zombies lying prone on the ground (sunbathing?) in almost perfectly spaced order, Agent Reyes opts to walk thru them instead of, say, around them.- A professor decides to check if the area is finally clear of poison gas. How? By removing his gas mask.- So what happened to that girl who was abandoned at the dock by the creepy reporter? She gets saved by the prophecy warrior but then we don't see her anymore.- Stick around for a mid-credits scene to see what happens to the reporter.

Along with his unique identities, he was addicted to a unique drug, something called DMX which is over the counter.  Ben has a bruise near one eye and we never learn why: was he punched?  did he fall?  is it a lesion?  Speaking of tragic mulatto, he tries to sneak services from a prostitute and then acts surprised when her pimp retaliates.  Initially, I asked myself if this is an example of the furor in the African-American community about \"the down low.\"  However, Ben spoke freely of prostituting himself and even his mother knew about it.

The story is obviously simple and if the movie has intrigued you in any way, then you probably weren't attracted to it for the story alone. Rutger Hauer is more than likely a drawing factor. The guy has talent and just seems to have trouble picking the right project to be a part of. Hobo with a Shotgun could definitely be considered over the top, but its ridiculously memorable one liners, low budget exploitation atmosphere, and nonstop use of practical effects for gore make you realize that even though Rutger Hauer is getting up there in years  he is still capable of picking entertaining projects to be a part of every now and then.There aren't too many one-liners that can be shared due to them being insanely vulgar as you can imagine, but there are a few that can be squeezed in here. \"I'm going to wash this blood off with your blood!\" One of the greatest aspects of the movie is that everything has this tongue in cheek kind of feel to it, so there's a sense of it not being taken completely seriously even though the actions on screen are fantastically gruesome and the entire cast seems to do their best to give a riveting performance. \"I'm gonna sleep in your bloody carcasses tonight!\" Rutger Hauer is the heart and soul of the movie. Without him the movie would've just been completely senseless. Hauer at least tries (and succeeds the majority of the time) of making you feel sympathy for this hobo who just wants to start a business for himself and do what he thinks is best for the city he's currently in. \"You and me are goin' on a car ride to hell... and you're riding shotgun!\" Blood plays a serious role in Jason Eisener's first directorial effort. Limbs get chopped to bits, heads get blown off and chopped off by barbed wire nooses tied to truck bumpers, razorblade bats slice open stomachs to unleash their caged intestines, even children aren't safe. It's a bloodsoaked ride from its fairly calm beginning to hellacious, shell heavy ending.There's a monologue Rutger Hauer makes outside the baby ward of a hospital that could easily be labeled as the key scene you can't miss in the movie. This is the best Hauer has been in years and most of his dialogue is the best it's been since Blade Runner. The lighting used in the movie is also really amazing. It's very drastic and usually yellow, red, purple, or blue. It gives the movie a retro feel, which fits perfectly with its exploitation homage. There's also this music that's used when The Plague first shows up that helps establish that atmosphere, as well. It sounds like it's very John Carpenter influenced and makes movies like this feel all the more genuine.Hobo with a Shotgun obviously isn't going to be for everybody. It won't win any Oscars and you probably won't see it on cable any time soon. This is a movie that takes something simple, stretches it as far as it will go, and actually does a really good job with it. There's chemistry amongst the entire cast, the make-up effects are really fantastic for a budget so small, and Rutger Hauer makes the audiences of today take notice of a 67 year old actor. It's bloody, excessive, and probably one of the easiest movies to turn your brain off during. Hobo with a Shotgun is a violently induced bloodbath that'll leave you joyously picking its impact out of your hair and clothes for days.Hobo with a Shotgun is seriously packed with special features. The first disc alone has two commentary tracks (one with director Jason Eisener and star Rutger Hauer, the other with Jason Eisener, writer John Davies, producer Rob Cotteril, and original \"hobo\" David Brunt) and Shotgun Mode, which is a behind the scenes interactive feature. Shotgun Mode is pretty cool. A bullseye pops up in the left corner of your screen at specific moments throughout the entire movie. You press enter on your remote and you're automatically taken behind the scenes of how that particular scene was shot along with goofing off between takes, how they built some of the more original weapons of the film, a walkthrough of the make-up effects, and much more.Disc 2 has even more extras. We start with the 45 minute documentary More Blood, More Heart, The Making of. This documentary is basically a walkthrough from the original Hobo with a Shotgun faux trailer that was entered into the Grindhouse contest that eventually evolves into a production blog of the feature film that runs through the film's completion. There are three deleted scenes and an alternate ending where Abby joins The Plague. Nine video blogs clock in at under a minute or less each. The most entertaining ones are the Interview with Niv and Budget Cuts blogs since Slick and Ivan show up and beat the snot out of Niv, one of the producers. A Camera Test Reel is exactly what it sounds like; the behind the scenes crew testing shots and locations without any of the actual on-screen cast present. Fangoria Interviews sit down with Rutget Hauer and Jason Eisener. Hauer's is a little over eleven minutes while Eisener's is over thirty. The HDNet: A Look at Hobo with a Shotgun feature is entertaining because Jason Eisener is all cuddled up with Rutger Hauer on a bed under a blanket. Then there's the original Hobo with a Shotgun Grindhouse trailer, the Hobo with a Shotgun Faux Trailer Contest Winner: Van Gore (which is awesome), the Red Band U.S. Theatrical Trailer, and Canadian TV Spots.This set contains at least two hours in special features and that's not including the commentary tracks or Shotgun Mode.

Drake's two sons, Ivan and Slick (Nick Bateman and Gregory Smith), are his right-hand men, and share in his love of everything unholy.

His effort strikes me as that of a student filmmaker attempting a homage to grindhouse.  This is not to say that there's not some things to recommend the film.

A hobo with a shopping cart or a hobo with a \"Will work for...\" whatever sign, we can deal with. But a hobo with a shotgun, you have to take him seriously, maybe even flip him more than just a quarter. HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN is hands down one of the best movie titles ever, right up there with, off the top of my head, SNAKES ON A PLANE, ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS, OCTOPUSSY (*tee-hee*), and SSSSSSS.Some background stuff: HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN, the motion picture, is based on the winning fake trailer of the same name that was submitted for an international movie trailer contest to promote Robert Rodriquez and Quentin Tarantino's then upcoming double feature GRINDHOUSE release. This is the second in GRINDHOUSE's batch of fake trailers to be turned into a feature film. The first, of course, is MACHETE. Is this the resurgence of the exploitation film? Dunno. But HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN, like MACHETE, is a bald-faced, unrepentant, gory homage to those cheap grindhouse thrillers that graced those dank movie theaters back in the '70s. Watching this, I half expected Pam Grier to put in a cameo.By the way, the original fake trailer for HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN can be seen in the DVD's bonus featurette focusing on David Brunt.The plot is bare bones. Rutger Hauer, now in his mid-60s and seriously weathered-looking, plays a vagabond who rode in on the rail and into Hope City, a lawless town and ironically-named. Hope City is run with sadistic zeal by a local gang lord named the Drake and his two hoodlum sons. If the grizzled hobo had his druthers, he'd purchase that secondhand lawnmower in the pawn shop and be content with clipping people's back yards. But every day he's haunted by the rampant thuggery taking place before his eyes. The hobo, who isn't exactly in his right mind nowadays, visits the pawnshop and eschews the lawnmower for the 12-gauge shotgun hanging over it. So cue that one newspaper headline screaming: \"Hobo stops begging, demands change!\"Oh, gorehounds, you'll eat up this vicious indie B-flick. For starters, you may dig the spaghetti western score which opens the film. It fits you in the proper frame of mind. The rampaging hobo, once unleashed, takes no prisoners. There's a gleefulness in how the film trots out its Rated R stuff; it wallows in the gore and the blood and the sheer visceral nature of the violence. Not to mention, HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN unloads a panoply of awful but ridiculously quotable quotes. I've got three favorites: One goon threatens his victim: \"I'm gonna wash away my blood... with your blood!\" He also boasts, \"They are going to make comics out of my hate crimes.\" And the big bad himself, the Drake, indulges in a bit of philosophy: \"When life gives you razor blades, you make a baseball bat... with razor blades.\"Rutger Hauer is just having fun with this role. I can't picture him as having approached his director to ask for his character's motivation. HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN is a bloody, profane, over-the-top romp. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is. It doesn't try to be clever. It just has the hobo blasting people to crimson, splattery bits and occasionally delivering some batty, melodramatic comment. Surprisingly, it's the gutsy token chick (Molly Dunsworth), and not the hobo, who has the inspirational speech moment. Facing down a mob, she talks about cleaning up the city and she growls, \"Sometimes, on the streets, a broom just ain't gonna f-----' cut it. That's when you gotta get a shotgun!\" Hoo-ah! I will say that late in the film Molly Dunsworth is showcased in several jaw-droppingly gristly moments. Except that GUTSY TOKEN CHICK WITH A SHOTGUN doesn't quite provoke that same reaction. Or am I wrong? Rumor has it that there's a clip floating around that was cut from the film which had the girl later joining the armored Plague demons. I wouldn't mind a spinoff film about that.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with director Jason Eisener and Rutger Hauer- Audio Commentary with Jason Eisener, writer John Davies, producer Rob Cotterill, and David Brunt- 44 behind-the-scenes featurettes which include table reads and on-site interviews, although my favorite segments have to do with the feature on David Brunt (the first-time actor who played the hobo in the original GRINDHOUSE fake trailer) and those in which the f/x crew experiments with different things - including egg shells filled with red liquid - to simulate splattered viscera and blood (totaling 01:46:20 minutes)", "term": "\"When life gives you razor blades, you make a baseball bat... with razor blades.\"", "id": "8799:1_0"}, "8800:1_0": {"polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I understand what they were going for, and I enjoy 70's/80's grindhouse stuff, but this isn't it..

Its pure violent pulp exploitation with no pretensions and in many respects its the purity of the concept which elevates it to something more than it would otherwise be. Its kind of like the old Sergio Leone westerns or something like the original Beastmaster or Road House or the first Boondock Saints.The film had its start as a phony trailer in an earlier bigger film. The trailer was a funny two-minute joke. But they managed to make it work for real as a film.A nameless hobo gets off a train in a new town with dreams of buying a lawnmower to start a business. But the streets are out of control and the hobo is forced to clean up the town on his own. The town is run by a violent goof named \"Drake\" and his two sons...one of whom looks like he stepped out of old Tom Cruise film like Risky Business. The villians are really easy to hate. The hobo is a no-nonsense hero.The film is slightly different than the old \"Death Wish\" formula because there is a clear wealth and class subtext to it. Most vigilante films feature middle class or rich victims taking revenge on psychotic criminals. But \"Hobo\" is about a man at the very bottom taking revenge on a corrupt system run by the wealthy and powerful who exist beyond the reach of any law. Going after the \"bumfights\" guy, going after the rich goof (Drake) and going after the idiot sons of the rich goof are all powerful concepts.And like all exploitation films, we get things that just don't make a bit of sense. Two Junior Iron men eventually show up with no particular explaination. But its so goofy, it works.The only thing that I have against it is that its too violent. Its in the nature of explotation, but I think the material was good enough that they could have done without it. An edited version would probably run on cable forever.The acting is 10x better than it has any right to be. Rutger Hauer was perfect for the role and delivers (as usual) a really solid performance in a third-rate role. This is not award winning acting, but its a role that some people would sleepwalk through (but he did not).Most homaige films are derivative and so tied to the source material that they can't ever even be as good as what they are swiping.

The film featured two movies that paid tribute to the type of film known as grindhouse films, exploitation films that played in the cheap theaters of New York's Times Square and across the country in most drive ins. They usually featured copious amounts of blood, breasts, gore, violence and were usually in pretty poor condition physically with scratched prints galore. The two directors also included fake previews of coming attractions in their film. Which led to a contest.The contest was to see if online readers could make their own coming attraction preview in the grindhouse mode. I honestly don't recall what the winner received with the exception of being known online as the winner. In this case the winner was Jason Eisner and his preview was for HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN. From that short preview Eisner found backing to make it into a feature film and switched from an unknown to movie star Rutger Hauer in the lead role. The film remains true to the preview and offers one of the goriest films ever made.Shot in an extra bright seemingly psychedelic palette of colors, the film opens with Hauer riding the rails and stopping to get off in a town renamed Scum Town via spray paint on the original sign. This town looks bad from the start. Trash fills the street, people are covered in dirt and grime and everyone seems to walk around in a daze.While picking up bottles to trade for cash, the Hobo watches as a man runs down the street begging for help, handcuffed and wearing what appears to be a manhole cover around his neck. Caught by a pair of bad guys doing their best Tom Cruise impersonations, their boss/father shows up. The Drake is mean with a capital M. This is his brother and he's unhappy with him but rather than give him a break, he drops him in a hole, puts a barb wire noose around his neck and after attaching the other end to his son's car decapitates him. The blood flows freely and excessively, a geyser of red that covers The Drake's scantily clad companion.The Hobo runs into the pair of sons again and enters their club unseen. He watches as a young woman named Abby stands up to the leader of the two and saves her from them; placing himself in danger should he be caught later on. Abby later befriends the Hobo and he tells her all he wants is enough money to buy a lawnmower and start his own business.Instead when he goes to buy the mower after making enough money, a trio of robbers enters the pawn shop where he's at and threatens everyone there. He makes a quick decision and walks past the lawnmower to the shotgun on the wall and opens up on the trio. The result is more flowing blood and gore. The Hobo becomes a hero of sorts, walking around town in broad daylight and shooting every violent miscreant that walks the streets.Of course this catches the eye of The Drake and he sends his sons out to take care of the situation. More gore, more blood and plenty of violence follows until the final showdown happens.If you understand the word Troma, then you'll know what to expect here. Outlandish simplistic plot, an overabundance of gore/blood and acting that is more often than not sub-par. There is no depth to the story here and people with necks sawed with a tree saw survive to fight again, people with broken limbs feel no pain after a face full of cocaine and the world continues to look crummy even as the end credits role.Fans of this sort of film and of Troma (who surprisingly had nothing to do with this film) pictures will adore this movie. Those who like more mainstream films will find their jaws dropping into their laps as they watch scene after scene. And those like me, somewhere in the middle, will appreciate the attempt at making a grindhouse epic while at the same time wondering why?

Originally a fake trailer created when Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino were bringing their Grindhouse film to the masses, here we are with a feature-length treatment for Hobo with a Shotgun, starring genre great Rutger Hauer in the title role.  When our Hobo hero arrives in a crime-ridden city, he quickly runs afoul of local crime boss Drake (Brian Downey from Lexx) and his two degenerate sons (Gregory Smith and Nick Bateman).  It isn't long before the sight of so much crime and pain and torment drives our Hobo over the edge and he gets his hands on the shotgun sitting in a pawn shop, and proceeds to wreck ultra-bloody havoc in the process.  Gleefully over the top and definitely not for the faint of heart, Hobo with a Shotgun represents just about the best aspects of what made the grindhouse and exploitation films of yesteryear so badly enjoyable to watch.  At the same time however, Hobo with a Shotgun also displays some of the worst aspects of the genre.  More often than not, it feels as if the film is trying way too hard to reach that level, and there are plenty of times where it's just too much.  Not to mention the fact that the acting is, well, let's just say it's kind of lacking in certain aspects.  I'm not looking for Shakespeare here, but other than Rutger Hauer, a majority of the cast is way too over the top for their own good.  Still, Hobo with a Shotgun is bloody, ultraviolent fun that never relents, and is the kind of ballsy genre filmmaking that has become all the more scarce as time has gone by.

I mean, you've got a hobo, you've got a shotgun, and it is reasonable to infer that there wouldn't be a movie unless said hobo had some people who richly deserved to have said shotgun turned on them. Am I wrong? Not according to Jason Eisener, Rob Cotterill, and John Davies, who wrote the script for this homage to the stupid, silly, utterly fun grindhouse classics of the seventies. Davies is new to the scriptwriting business, but Eisener and Cotterill gave the world the equally stupid/fun Treevenge back in 2008, so you can be reasonably certain that yes, this movie is going to rock. And it will not let you down.The hobo in question, played by the wonderful Rutger Hauer (Bladerunner), is never named. And why should he be? He's an everyman figure from a long tradition of wandering everymen. He decides to settle down in a bucolic small town, get himself a nice little house with a picket fence and a lawn he can mow. It's the American dream, right? Unfortunately, our hobo hopped off the train in the wrong town indeed; the entire place is corrupt. Even the air smells like violence. Less than five minutes after he heads into town, he's approached by a guy who produces bumfight videos, but on a whole other level than we're used to seeing in the real world (two bums enter, one bum leaves!). And that's just the tip of the iceberg. It seems that, in order to get his bucolic small town to actually be bucolic, our hero is going to have to do a bit of cleanup. So he takes the money he's been saving to buy a lawnmower and instead invests in a shotgun...and a whole lot of ammo.It's ridiculous, it's basically plotless (though the \"let's clean up the corrupt town\" plot was popular enough in the seventies that I can think of a half-dozen movies that used it off the top of my head--at least one of which, Walking Tall, has been remade in the last decade), and as long as you don't mind the clearly over-the-top violence, it's a barrel of fun. I will say that Eisener and co. do overplay their hand in establishing that the violence is over-the-top from the get-go, and some of those early scenes are pretty uncomfortable viewing until you've figured out that they're going out of their way to emphasize the fakeness, the cartoonery, of the violence. Once you've got that idea, it turns into an all-out romp, and if you're not rooting for the hobo after fifteen minutes, man, you just don't have a heart, or at least not a beating one. Eisener has given us a universal character, done his best to make that character sympathetic (and did a pretty durned good job), and then let him loose.If the movie has a failing, it's that Eisener, when he gets to the movie's climax, pulls his punches at a crucial time. Yes, it works in the sense that the movie is resolved satisfactorily, but Eisener, by that time, has the weight of four hundred plus years of everyman narratives weighing down on Rutger Hauer's shoulders, and changing the way this narrative works out, even if it does play well in Poughkeepsie, kind of undercuts all that history.  I know I'm being hypocritical here (I dinged, rather heavily, Ann Patchett for sticking to the classical climax in Bel Canto rather than updating it for a more modern, realistic ending), but I will rationalize that by saying that Eisener did such a great job in building the hobo's character that I wanted to see...this movie work out differently than it did, which is about as much as I can say without venturing far into spoiler territory.Either way, it's a fantastically fun little movie, well worth your time.

The director was present in the theater but I didn't speak to him then(too bad), but I always remembered the trailer.  I never thought it would actually become a feature film, let alone star Rutger Hauer.So here we are-Hobo With A Shotgun is a reality, and the exploitation world is the better for it.  Basically it's about a hobo that comes into a crime ridden town and decides to go Bronson when he's seen(and experienced) enough.  The town in the movie is super exaggerated in it's criminal activity-it's a friggin' warzone!  Think of the gang ruled neighborhood in Death Wish 3 and that's how this entire town is!  But then again, everything here is exaggerated.  This movie is very cartoony and brings to mind images of Troma(in fact, a character in the film is wearing a Troma shirt in one scene).  Rutger Hauer is the odd one out in that he's basically the \"normal\", non-cartoon character here.  And that really makes it work.  His downplaying against everyone else's over the top playing really helps give the movie that additional edge to bring it above being total silliness(along with the hot young lady who plays the prostitute.  I forgot her name at the moment).  We all love Hauer, you'd have to be some kind of communist not to.  Though he's been in numerous B movies throughout the years, we've never seen him in something quite like this, something more tongue in cheek.  Movies like Bleeders, Crossworlds and Turbulence 3-Heavy Metal were schlock, but schlock taking itself a bit more seriously.  It's a nice change of pace for Hauer.The film has a decent amount of gore.  Some say it surpasses Machete.  I'm not sure if it does.  Perhaps, but unlike Machete, the gore here is not CGI, which elevates it substantially.The second disc(if you're thinking of buying the 2 disc version) has a nice Making Of.. documentary, interviews with Hauer and director Eisener by Fangoria magazine, the alternate ending, and the original fake trailer(though this may be on disc one, I forgot).  I haven't watched the film on \"Shotgun Mode\" yet, so I'm not sure on that one.All in all, a very good \"grindhouse\" style film here.

It has Grindhouse qualities mingled with overkill and that strange hero, and the humor mingled with the violence might go right past some people. If that sounds bad to you, let it go or watch it later. Anyone else, you might like this.Hobo with a Shotgun is a tale of a homeless man who seems to have a lot of bad breaks. He is not down on things, however, and seems content with certain aspects of his life. Still, he has a dream. He wants to buy a lawnmower and get out. Then he sees a girl, his \"schoolteacher,\" and notices that she is about to become a victim. That sets him on a collison course with the guys running the whole of the town he is taking on.First, let me sau that the acting and the lines here were great. I have always been a fan of Rutger anyhow, and this portrayal is a nice one. His character reminds me of someone that is going for that Man with No Name feel, and he does it well. He has this look, almost always angry and certainly mad in some respect, but there is a bit of hope in him. He also has lines like \"I'll be sleeping in your carcass tonight\" and \"I'll be carving welfare checks out of your skin,\" working to reinforce the Hobo aspect of his persona. It worked for me.The setting itself is one tha seems like a world gone mad. There are times when blood opens and sprays and when drugs are thrown out in piles. In fact, there is barely any realism to the hyper violence and I think that works. Too many people are turned aside by that and, honestly, how many fingers can one person lose before the following line is not funny if it really looks real?The bad guys range from ordinary people being enslaved to their lifestyles to pimps and more. Stil, there is one major bad guy and his sons. The Drake and his sons, Slick and Ivan, are pretty funny in their own rights. They really have something to add and they bring their own type of killing to the set. Honestly, I loved the way they played here, too.If you do not want the blood mingled with, well, blood, you might miss the type of film this is. Also, you are not going to see people go unscathed too often. This is a new good guy that emerges from a bad place, but the things that happen are not exactly lovely.

It takes a situation more common to westerns, and places it in a modern urban setting, where an innocent stranger arrives in town, and tries to do the right thing when he encounters injustice, only to discover that the police are corrupt.  Attempting to move on and make an honest living, the man reacts with violence when threatened, taking the law into his own hands, and embarking on a path of bloody violence and destruction.  Spoilers follow.Arriving in a city on a passing train, the Hobo (Rutger Hauer) witnesses The Drake (Brian Downey), and his sons Ivan (Nick Bateman) and Slick (Gregory Smith), abusing a man wearing a manhole cover around his neck.  The Drake is an underworld leader, and the man, who happens to be his brother, is dropped into a manhole, and then decapitated using a car.Spotting a lawn mower for sale in a pawn shop, the Hobo decides to save up to buy it, and try and make his living cutting lawns.  Outside an arcade, Slick attacks a prostitute named Abby (Molly Dunsworth), but is knocked out by the Hobo, who takes the scumbag to the police station.  Instead of arresting him, the police chief turns Slick loose, and he and his brother attack the Hobo, and then toss him into a dumpster.  Fortunately the Hobo runs into Abby, who gives him a place to stay for the night.The Hobo degrades himself to earn enough cash to buy the lawnmower, and is in the pawn shop when three thugs enter and attempt to rob the place.  Faced with a crisis, the Hobo picks up a shotgun, which just happens to be loaded, and blows away the punks.  He then begins to clean up the town, eliminating anyone he perceives is guilty.  After blowing apart a horny cop, the Hobo is reunited with Abby.  They intend to run away together, but with The Drake and his sons standing in their way, the path out of town proves to be a bloody one.Reality isn't intended to be a major factor in Hobo With A Shotgun.  The point is to establish a reason for all hell to break loose, and then open the floodgates to mayhem, highlighted by some outrageously cool gore.  With that understood, the movie hits most of its goals, and while quite nasty, the movie is perhaps less violent than it could have been, as there was clearly potential for more sexual violence and brutality from the villains.Rutger Hauer (The Hitcher,Blade Runner) is great as the Hobo, bringing a kind of world weary resignation to the role, as he obliterates the dregs of the town.  As an older man however, he doesn't bring the same kind of energy and rage that a younger actor could have.  The Hobo doesn't do much fighting, and relies mostly on his shotgun.  The character Abby takes quite a wild ride, going from a victim about to bleed out and die, to an armored street warrior.  She doesn't quite make the transition to killer gladiator, as she is cruelly maimed by a lawnmower, but she still manages to strike back and defend herself.  This bleak adventure not intended for the faint of heart.  In a place so depraved and evil, there can be no happy endings for anyone.  If you are a fan of revenge films, give this one a watch.

Other networks soon passed on the finished product, and this television production was all but demonized before it even saw the light of day. What exactly has this miniseries been found guilty of? It plays fast and loose with some of the facts? Well, this isn't a documentary, that's for sure--but who expected it would be? As a superficial and fictional presentation, it is not the least bit surprising that elements of the story are emphasized for entertainment purposes. This is a dramatization, not unlike dozens of others that populate feature films and TV movies, that embellishes its story to fit a certain format. Are the Kennedys really that untouchable? As fodder for countless films, TV shows, and novels through the years (perhaps more so than any other family in history), the Kennedy story has been covered from almost every angle--from reverential to scurrilous. Anyone who is scandalized by \"The Kennedys\" must surely have had their head in the sand about the clan. I have viewed and read dozens of far more incendiary provocations over the last 30 years!If anything, this miniseries is guilty of being an old fashioned TV product--a throw back to the days before cable ruled the adult viewing audience. In fact, for that reason alone, the presentation is surprisingly tepid--in other hands, this might have been turned into a piece worthy of controversy. Okay, I promise to get off my soapbox now and talk about the actual film. Shot in eight bite sized nuggets (I mean episodes), \"The Kennedys\" does not purport to be a comprehensive biography. Each episode tends to have a central theme or plot point and hits the appropriate historical markers with precision. It is not an in-depth look at either history or politics, but rather a glossy overview of recognizable historical moments amidst soap opera turmoil. It is an entertaining, if superficial, peak at the intricacies inherent in being involved as a power player in media and politics.Far more intriguing than the paint by numbers romp through history is the cast. Tom Wilkinson is absolutely magnetic as family patriarch Joe. Had this aired on a network other than Reelz, there is no doubt in my mind that he would have been under Emmy scrutiny. Fiery, uncompromising, meticulous, and riddled with ambition--this is a star turn from one of our best actors. Diana Hardcastle, as matriarch Rose, doesn't have as much screen time--but hers is an equally vivid performance. A fine combination of haughty and devout, I think I laughed at just about everything she says--a true scene stealing role. Greg Kinnear acquits himself well handling the complexities of JFK while Barry Pepper turns in a terrific performance as Bobby. Only Katie Holmes (and I'm not a hater) falls a bit short, for my taste, with the overly breathy Jackie. The supporting cast is enlivened by some solid turns and famous faces. Sinatra, Monroe, Hoover, and Giancana (among others) are all nicely done.\"The Kennedys,\" again while capitalizing on more colorful aspects of the story, never commits the sin of being dull. And, in truth, that's its greatest accomplishment. The story is so familiar, I was hesitant to revisit yet another tale of America's First Family. But I'm glad I did--mainly for the able and game cast who really seem to come across as related. A special mention goes out to the make-up team--with slight modifications, Pepper and Kinnear look the part while still being recognizable. If you go into this thinking it will be \"too hot for TV,\" you'll likely be disappointed. This is a classic network TV style miniseries that is well done.

Scatology, substance abuse and sexual deviance drive Workaholics' creative engine not as gratuitous gross-out humor but as serious philosophical and personal issues for our protagonists. Pop culture is approached with a similarly solemn face, meaning boys don't reference Nickelodeon's Double Dare, Dateline's \"To Catch A Predator\" and The Insane Clown Posse as one-off jokes, but as major story points within episodes.None of these innovations would coalesce if actors/creators Anderson, DeVine, and Holm didn't have such spectacular comedic chemistry with one another. The trio created the show after accumulating years of improv and viral video experience together, making their \"best friend\" interplay organic and believable. Each represents a different archetype of buddy comedies--Holm is the responsible one, Anderson is the quirky guy, and DeVine is the clueless leader. With the meta use of their own names and storylines culled from real life experiences, the guys are play stylized versions of themselves (comparable to Larry David's work in Curb Your Enthusiasm) giving the show a naturally spontaneous feel that's refreshing in a sitcom.This meta premise also adds extra dimensions to the characters, letting the performers take their characters down roads that border skirt the lines of insanity and narcissism without freeing the characters of conscious and empathy. They're bros, after all, and always rely on the bond their friendship to claw their way out of whatever ridiculous problem they face each episode. Unlike the characters populating the similarly anarchic It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, it's hard not to sympathize with stoners like Blake, Adam, and Anders. They love each other, and we love them for it.Great praise must also be showered upon the show's writing. Dialogue consistently crackles with pseudo hip-hop slang and some of the most creative profanity ever realized on the small screen. Not only that, but the show's ability to consistently subvert audience expectations without relying on gimmicks or false plot twists deserves a rousing applause. Though their numbers are too large to list here, accolades must be given to the writing staff and showrunners of Workaholics as some of the freshest comedy writing on television.As if I couldn't recommend Workaholics enough, Comedy Central comes through with a DVD absolutely stacked with content.The technical specs check out solidly. The show is shot on a fairly small budget, so the somewhat fuzzy 1.78.1 transfer won't blow minds, but proves serviceable for a shot-on-digital show about workaday potheads. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track fares a little better, boasting very clear dialogue and a thumping hip-hop theme that you'll never tire of hearing.The extras that are where Workaholics: Season One really shine. Included in the set is cast interviews, deleted/alternate scenes, Workaholics digital originals, a live Workaholics sketch (as performed at Bonnaroo), outtakes, and (fittingly inebriated) audio commentaries for each episode. Rather than pick apart each extra bit-by-bit and step on the jokes, I will only say every supplement sampled here made me laugh as hard as the show itself. If the bonus material is to be trusted, the Workaholics crew are just as hilarious outside the show as they are on it.

It is a quintessential stoner/slacker comedy featuring three friends as they adapt (or refuse to adapt) to the increasingly complex world of adulthood. The guys are continuously rude, obnoxious and/or clueless and yet the bonds of their friendship may stretch, but never break--even when they behave in the most horrifying ways to one another. Unabashedly silly and crude, and oftentimes hilarious, this comedy makes no apologies for what it is. Not for sensitive viewers, this is in-your-face aggressive without a concern for political correctness or appropriateness. It is the irreverent \"anything can happen\" feel that is the core selling point for this ridiculously appealing show. I suspect that if you enjoy the wild antics of \"Workaholics,\" you will become a fervent and vocal supporter of the show. If, however, it all seems a bit juvenile for your taste--there is a good chance you will absolutely loathe this program. This could very well be a love-it or hate-it proposition.Season One lines up ten episodes which spend about equal time between work and other recreational activities. Some of the strongest episodes do deal specifically with the job site. In one episode, the boys vie for a promotion and their warfare against one another becomes increasingly brutal. In another, the boys organize a strike when the bosses won't recognize a completely ridiculous holiday. The season finale (with an invaluable assist by guest Chris Parnell as the company's CEO) has the guys fighting to save the company itself! It's all over-the-top and silly but that's the charm. In one of the show's most uncomfortable episodes, the boys befriend a child predator because he's a cool guy. Hey, you can't argue with that kind of reasoning!The show succeeds on the chemistry between its leads--Anders Holm, Blake Anderson, and Adam DeVine. While all fill their particular niche to perfection, it is Holm that is the stand-out for me. The only character that straddles the worlds of adolescence and adulthood--he is oftentimes made the stooge for trying to be successful. Jillian Bell provides great support as an off-beat co-worker that gets into her share of trouble as well, and Maribeth Monroe is delightful as the boss consistently pushed over the edge of reason. This is a deft comedy of slapstick and silliness. Its humor is crude and juvenile. If you don't like that sort of thing--then, by all means, stay far away. If, however, your looking for a good fix of rude and rollicking laughs--give it a shot.

A non-sale, non-discounted price of 19.95 fits in line with almost six hours worth of DVD content. A full season, had it been released that way, would simply have doubled the asking price.Last year, History and A&E; Television made the dubious decision to start releasing Volumes of their most popular shows as opposed to Seasons. I was one of the most vocal opponents of this move and some of my scathing tirades can be found on those initial releases. In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then switch tactics mid-stream to confuse unsuspecting buyers.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!Last year, many of these early Volume releases broke my second and third rule. I mean really! How can you release a DVD when it's not a full season and NOT tell buyers how many and which episodes are included? Absolutely unforgivable. I need that information to decide whether or not I want to purchase the set. As we have progressed, though, and the notion that we're to continue with Volume releasing has stayed with us, the point becomes rather more muddy. Now, we're past the second issue and the third issue has been corrected. All of these Volume releases now contain information about the content. So, there is no deception and no confusion. You get \"x\" number of episodes for \"x\" price. It's now up to you whether or not it's worth it. That's fair. If you don't like it, don't buy it.Volume Four of \"Pawn Stars\" contains sixteen episodes over two discs for just shy of six hours worth of content, basically consisting of the second half of Season Three. There are no Special features, but English and Spanish subtitles are optional. Included:(1) Cornering the Colonel, (2) Ready, Set, Pawn, (3) The Eagle Has Landed, (4) Like A Rolling Chum, (5) Hello Nurse, (6) Chumdog Millionaire, (7) Gone With the Schwinn, (8) Bare Bones, (9) Never Surrender, (10) Honest Abe, (11) Monkey Business, (12) Packing Heat, (13) Luck of the Draw, (14) Houdini's Handcuffs, (15) Pedal to the Metal, and (16) Case Closed.The show is entertaining for several reasons. Of course, some intriguing merchandise passes through their hands and you just might learn something. But as in any reality show, this one is as much about interaction and conversation as it is about the art of the deal. The Harrison guys are a colorful crew--real old school Vegas. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer is Chumlee (like an adopted son) who plays village idiot, but can surprise you as well. It's comical and engaging for the most part. All in all, it is rather like the unsavory and confrontational cousin to the classic \"Antiques Roadshow\" with more grit and edge.

This is the initial directing outing for Iranian-American writer Massy Tadjedin ('The Jacket', 'Leo') who also created the story and the script: the film is so fine that we doubtless will be hearing more about her.Joanna Reed (Keira Knightley) is a beautiful young writer married to commercial real estate developer Michael Reed (Sam Worthington) in what appears to be a happy marriage despite the struggle between two careers. Michael takes Joanna to a company party and there she observes the soft spoken Michael paying attention to one of his co-workers, the sensuous Laura (Eva Mendes), an act that Joanna feels indicates unfaithfulness or at least suspicious behavior on Michael's part. The seed of doubt is planted, Michael is leaving for a business trip to Philadelphia the next morning with his coworkers Andy (Anson Mount) and Laura, and there is friction between Joanna and Michael that Michael's reassurance cannot overcome. The next day as Joanna sops for coffee she encounters an old flame from her time spent writing in Paris - Alex Mann (Guillaume Canet) - and they agree to meet that evening. Chemistry resurges and that evening as Alex and Joanna dine with Alex's publisher Truman (Griffin Dunne), both are questioned by Truman about their past affair, Joanna admits she is now married, and Alex is in a relationship in Paris. The couple leaves and circumstances lead them to return to Joanna's apartment where they face their feelings. At the same time as this evening is developing Michael and Laura enter a seduction dance: Michael is faithful to Joanna but the emotionally bruised Laura persists in her attempt to pull Michael into her web. The manner in which each of these temptations resolves and the aftermath is the brilliance of Massy's writing and direction: this is a story written very much form a women's vantage and that fact allows each of the characters to become very well defined and credible.The quartet of actors is well matched: Knightley continues to mature as a fine actress, Sam Worthington breaks out of his stodgy shell to allow us to see a man driven by fidelity and tempted by lust, Eva Mendes takes Laura to a higher dimension of being, and Guillaume Canet is undeniably an Alex who few women could resist: he has true star power. The method of pairing the development of the one night by flashing back and forth between the progress of the two couples in the dance of seduction vs fidelity is extremely successful. This is a thinking person's movie and an introduction of a writer/director who already has shaped the beginnings of a successful career. Highly Recommended.

Twenty-somethings Joanna (Keira Knightley) and Michael (Sam Worthington) have been married for a couple years but have known each other \"since college.\"  By all accounts they are happy but when they attend a cocktail party sponsored by Michael's boss (Anson Mount), Joanna learns that Michael has been working with a new employee (Eva Mendes).  She is sophisticated and beautiful and Michael never mentioned her.After a fight that night, Michael leaves on a business trip with his associate Andy (Daniel Eric Gold) and yep, Laura (Mendes).  At this point, we're not sure if Joanna should be worried as Michael appears to be honest with his wife.  After Michael leaves, Joanna goes down the block from her cool Manhattan apartment to get some coffee and runs into an old flame from Paris (Guillaume Canet).  Wow, what a coincidence!  He invites her out to dinner with another couple.  She primps and purrs but we're not sure if she's on the prowl or just wants a little flirtatious attention.One of the best characters in this movie is one of the friends played by Griffin Dunne.  He gives Joanna and Alex (Canet) the third degree but does it in such a playful, inventive way it doesn't seem overly intrusive or personal.  From here director/writer Massy Tadjedin goes back and forth in scenes between the 2 couples and the will they or won't they conflict.  When asked by Laura, as they paddle about a hotel swimming pool in their underwear, as to whether Michael is happy with his marriage, he responds, \"You can be happy and still be tempted.\"  Great line.Without giving away too much, I've always wondered which is worse in terms of marriage fidelity.  To do everything emotionally romantic both physically and mentally except engage in an actual sex act and remain technically faithful or have meaningless sex.  For the most part, Ms. Tadjedin keeps things in balance but I suspect this film will have more appeal to the fairer sex.As far as the Blu ray quality, it is a 1080p in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.

I am loathe to review an available season without having watched it in its entirety, but I just couldn't get thru many eps of this... there is only so much dim-witted posturing, backstabbing, lying, and general ugliness that I can handle in any given month (when not balanced out by creativity and other redeeming qualities, as in a work of fiction).From a purely anthropological viewpoint, however, this show has some worth. It provides a small bit of insight into what a blue collar criminal lifestyle can lead to: material wealth, broken families, and a mindset of coming at problems shouting and predisposed to violence. Since Mob Wives is not without context, it also offers perspective on a broader (societal) scale. It is, more often than not, a sickening serial to watch, even if you are prone to being entertained by low culture.

Add to that, I have been a tireless devotee to the brilliant Bruce Campbell for more years than I care to recognize in print (decades!). So, this made-for TV movie seemed like a can't miss proposition. And, indeed, it begins on a decidedly whimsical note as Campbell faces a military tribunal for an escapade gone wrong. With his trademark bluster, Campbell challenges authority like no one else! His character has become a fan favorite over the years due to his verbal interplay with his series's co-stars Gabrielle Anwar and, most notably, Jeffrey Donovan. Donovan directs this tepid prequel and puts in a cameo, but its just long enough to highlight what's missing from this incarnation of the Burn Notice saga.As much as I liked the comedic stylings of the present day military sequences, one would expect a terrific, funny and larger than life episode to showcase Sam's outrageousness. In fact, the jungle exploits between a corrupt military junta and a ragtag band of rebel fighters just seems far too easy and conventional. In a set-up used in countless other films, Sam is sent as an observer to a third world nationality and discovers that all is not as it seems in their plight with rebel forces. Soon Sam is in the thick of things protecting an altruistic hospital (sweet) and its strong and dedicated American/Canadian doctors (no language barriers here!). But it is a sassy rebel orphan who really seals the deal in this film. Painfully unreal and contrived, the girl exists to personalize the story--but is just one more example of a character construct as opposed to a real person. That's right, the great Campbell's principle foil is a precocious teen--uggh!The strength of Burn Notice, as I mentioned above, is in its verbal pyrotechnics. The characters play off one another with rapid fire dexterity, and Campbell is an integral part of that success. Here, the script lacks the savvy and the smarts necessary to make this must-see entertainment and Campbell's big persona fails to have a match in the likable, if forgettable, ensemble of the film. Another part of the series' charm comes from stylish adventure and a palpable sense of danger. Here, the action is straightforward and lacking the visual flair we'd expect from the show. And as for danger, there's never a doubt as to the outcome of this fairly generic tale. As a Campbell enthusiast, I prefer his campier film forays and as a Burn Notice fan--this only hinted at the elements which distinguish the show.

It definitely misses things like the character interaction, quick wit and even the voice overs you get in the series.

Quite a while ago I read an article in which one of the writers - perhaps it was Stephen Moffat, though it was back in the days when RTD was the script wrangler for the series - that a really good Doctor Who episode is the equivalent to a 60-minute film. It should be more or less complete in and of itself, and so packed with ideas, great dialog and excellent camerawork that you're left feeling totally satisfied. Every once in a while Doctor Who achieves this gold standard. For me, such perfect episodes include Rose, The Girl In the Fireplace, Blink, Turn Left, the very first episode with Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor, and now this one.Not only are we carried along a dual-time stream plot (one compressed a la Othello, the other linear as we watch) that is full of pathos, but in addition the camerawork is absolutely superb. This may be the single best and most consistent use of camera-as-storyteller I've ever seen. Much of the effect is achieved by counterpointing the aged Amy with her younger self in very clever side-by-side shots and overlays. It's really easy to do this kind of thing badly so the viewer is aware of the trick at the expense of the emotion; here it's the opposite, with the camerawork actually pushing the emotion deeper and further than it would otherwise go with straight shots. This is the kind of direction and camerawork that deserves an award - yet it's easy not to notice it particularly because it's all in the service of the story, which is compelling, sad, and doesn't provide an easy way out when the ultimate choice must be made: which Amy to save?For me, one of the very satisfying things was the clever set-up for the denoeument: the hand-bots phrase \"this is a kindness.\" At first, because the \"kindness\" will in fact be lethal to Amy, it's just scary - a great contradiction between word and deed. But in the end, when the Tardis must depart and leave the aged Amy behind, the words come true. It is, at the very end, in a heartbreaking kind of way, after all a kindness.If you don't know much about Doctor Who, this episode is as good as any as a place to start - and then you can have the pleasure of going all the way back to the first episode of the reboot with Christopher Ecclestone as the Ninth Doctor, and go forward from there.

And a good thing, too, because head cheese showrunner Steven Moffat truly puts the - as an embittered Amy Pond refers to him - \"blue box man flying thru time and space on whimsy\" - thru the wringer. Here's DOCTOR WHO: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SERIES, and it's a dark and twisty and gloriously mad season, it is.Who knows what goes on in Steven Moffat's labyrinthine mind? He certainly knows how to deliver a story, knows how to hook you in. More crucially, he's able to introduce an overarching storyline which engages one for the long haul. He's clever with parceling out the occasional tease or plot progression. It's amazing how much I loved Series 5 and yet how much more I love this latest series. These episodes, for the most part, convey surprising emotional heft and a self-assured swagger. There is a richness and a verve. There is this steamrolling effect. It helps that Matt Smith seems to have chemistry with anyone, although the gorgeous Karen Gillan and long-suffering Arthur Darvill truly come into their own this year. Not that the Doctor has had a married couple as companions before, but Amy Pond and Rory would hands down qualify as the most awesomemest (someone please give these two their own spin-off series).How much doozier could you have it than the two-part opener: \"The Impossible Astronaut\" and \"Day of the Moon\"? This arc heralds the Doctor's death, which is set in panoramic Utah, and which unveils in the Silence one of the best big bads in Doctor Who's rogues gallery. The Silence... think Weeping Angels, but in reverse. And to top it off, the two-parter hurls our cast time traveling back to 1963, era of President Nixon and the historical space race. All these elements combine to produce two of the most exciting Doctor Who episodes I've ever seen. Going forward, don't tell me you weren't curious as to how Moffat was going to pull this one off. It's pretty ballsy launching a season by killing off your lead character. The Doctor, murdered at 5:02pm by an astronaut emerging from the waters of Lake Silencio, Utah. It's a mystery what doesn't get resolved until Series 6's final episode.This 6-disc set starts off with the brilliant holiday episode \"A Christmas Carol,\" in which the Doctor applies a smidge of time travel to instill conscience in a heartless man, a miserly creature who is \"halfway out of the dark,\" meaning there's yet hope for him. Co-starring an excellent Michael Gambon and an ethereal Katherine Jenkins, this ep is already being touted as a classic. And for those who've been raring to learn River Song's true identity, \" A Good Man Goes to War\" is your huckleberry, although odds are, you may've already worked it out. I'll be honest and say that I don't really fancy Alex Kingston all that much, so all the drama regarding River Song has left me inhabiting the neighborhood of \"meh,\" in the zip code of \"Huh.\" Other than the unimpressive \"The Curse of the Black Spot,\" Series 6 comes strong with terrific episodes, so strong that it's easier for me to mention the one episode I truly found lacking (again, \"The Curse of the Black Spot\"). And, to keep everyone in the proper mood, note that these episodes tend to circle back 'round to the themes touched on in the season opener (the Doctor's looming death, the puzzle of River Song, the Silence's role, etc.). Neil Gaiman demonstrates his virtuoso writing with the magnificent \"The Doctor's Wife,\" which showcases possibly the most important woman in the Doctor's life. And while the Doctor struts his stuff in \"A Good Man Goes to War,\" I remember it most for Rory's kickarse bracing of the Cybermen.The heartwrenching \"The Girl Who Waited\" features perhaps Karen Gillan's best work, as the Doctor and Rory desperately work to save two versions of Amy Pond, only to learn that they can only salvage one. \"Closing Time\" is the most lighthearted episode and has the Doctor visiting his bumbling former flat mate Craig Owens (from \"The Lodger\") and meeting Craig's new baby. It's neat that the Doctor can speak baby, and how big was my grin when the Doctor mentions the baby's self-given name: \"Stormageddon, Lord of All.\" The Doctor, Craig, and \"Stormy\" are just in time to confound a Cybermen invasion being staged from the local department store. Finally, there's no denying the epic scope of \"The Wedding of River Song,\" the Series 6 finale, just as there's no denying the jaggedy feel permeating the opening sequences. Still, just bide a bit and it'll sort itself out. Plus, the episode treats you to a Winston Churchill sighting and a moving send-off for the Brigadier. However, one nitpick I nurse is that the creepy eyepatched lady, Madame Kovarian, after the season-long set-up, is given short shrift, is disposed of pretty handily in this ep. But never mind. In \"The Wedding of River Song,\" clues are pieced together, mysteries are clarified, while even more questions are asked, including that one all-important (and apparently glaringly obvious) question which begs to be answered in the coming two seasons. And then Silence will fall. Looks like the stage is being set for a hell of a 50th anniversary.The DVD set's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary on 5 episodes: Arthur Darvill, producer Marcus Wilson, and line producer David Mason on the \"Impossible Astronaut\"; Neil friggin' Gaiman on \"The Doctor's Wife\"; actors Marshall Lancaster and Mark Bonnar and director Julian Simpson on \"The Rebel Flesh\"; Arthur Darvill, actress Neve McIntosh and set visual effects supervisor Tim Barter on \"A Good Man Goes to War\"; and Steven Moffat, actress Frances Barber (\"Madame Kovarian\"), and director Jeremy Webb on \"The Wedding of River Song\"- 2 Comic Relief Sketches: \"Space\" & \"Time\" - Amy is jealous that the Doctor allows Rory to perform maintenance on the TARDIS, but then a blue police box appears in the TARDIS as the space-time continuum yet again gets a mucking around (the two sketches total 00:03:59 minutes)- 14 DOCTOR WHO Confidentials, including a comprehensive one-hour-long Confidential for \"A Christmas Carol\"- 5 \"Night and the Doctor\" Additional Scenes - A peek into what goes on in the TARDIS in between adventures. Apparently, while Amy and Rory sleep, the Doctor sneaks out and attends parties. Except that the last segment \"Up All Night\" seems more like a prequel to the episode \"Closing Time\" (totaling 00:16:08 minutes)- \"DOCTOR WHO Confidential: \"The Nights' Tale\" - behind the scenes of the making of the two Comic Relief Sketches and the \"Night and the Doctor\" shorts (00:15:11 minutes)- 4 \"Monster Files\" on the Silence, the Gangers, the Anti-Bodies, and the Cybermat (a.k.a. \"that silver rat thing\")- 5 Prequels (for \"The Impossible Astronaut,\" \"The Curse of the Black Spot,\" \"A Good Man Goes to War,\" \"Let's Kill Hitler,\" and \"The Wedding of River Song\")- 2 Midseason Trailers", "term": "\"blue box man flying thru time and space on whimsy...\"", "id": "9025:1_0"}, "9026:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The silence were a welcome addition as an enemy with very creative characteristics, possibly rivaling the weeping angels in awesomeness.

With Richard Nixon and his sidekick in tow, it seems that things have gone bad and the others are being hunted while the Doctor has a bad time. you know the doctor, however, and how good he is.This episode wraps up a first piece and explains what the enemy well be. I do not want to say so I will omit it, but I did not expect the name. I also did not expect the man and his love and Nixon and the kid, and I did not expect Amy and the revelation she had. I think she has something big coming and people have yet to notice.The acting is great here. Matt Smith has settled into the doctor and has his guy down pat. It makes me laugh, he has such an energetic humor, and I like that. I also liked the dark here and I thought they had plenty of it.

And unless they manage to tie this episode in somehow with the other episodes, it becomes pointless and possibly even absurd when considered in the bigger picture of the entire season. The doctor is going to die, we're in the second half of the season, and instead of figuring things out about the doctor's death, they go sightseeing. \"Sightseeing\" episodes are much better at the beginning of the season. Either that, or they must be very interesting, like \"Midnight\" in season 4. Part of the reason could be the person who wrote this episode: Tom MacRae wrote this episode, and unlike the two episodes he wrote way back in Season 2 (\"Rise of the Cybermen\" and \"The Age of Steel\"), it is simply not that good. The question of two Amy's brings back memories of \"Father's Day\" in episode 1 and the problem of having the same person meet at different points in their timeline. Of course, this brings up some interesting questions involving the Reapers who are supposed to appear when someone changes their own timeline. Does Amy's helping of her past self warrant a big enough time disturbance to bring in the Reapers? When you consider that when Rose touches the younger version of herself, causing the Reapers to gain more power, it would seem that the problem with space-time should have been much bigger.

Writer/producer Moffat has made \"Doctor Who\" his own show (much as his predecessor Russell T. Davies did) in a sense rebooting the series with a new Doctor (Matt Smith)during the fifth season, a pair of new companions (Karen Gillian as Amy Pond and Arthur Darvil as Rory) who plays a role almost as important as the Doctor himself. It's a clever story arc that at times gets lost in its own cleverness but always returns to what makes the series fun. Smith has made the role his own which given the performances of his predecessors is saying something.Moffat ties together the story strands from previous seasons including the origin of Dr. River Song (Alex Kingston). Any season that features one of my favorite actors Mark Sheppard (\"Battlestar: Galatica\", \"Supernatural\" and \"Burn Notice\" among other shows--please someone get this man a series!)is given a bit of leeway.I do hope though that Moffat will move away from the all powerful Doctor as it would eventually become something of a narrative dead end for the show. There is a bit of noticeable banding now and again but on the whole the presentation is exceptionally good.The Blu-ray for \"Doctor Who\" receives a marvelous looking transfer for home video in high def. Colors pop (well, when they're supposed to)and the show looks remarkably sharp with strong fine detail.Audio sounds quite strong with a nice immersive 5.1 lossless mix but dialogue is quite strong.Special features include a number of fun, informative commentary tracks for the following episodes: \"The Impossible Astronaut\",\"The Doctor's Wife\",\"The Rebel Flesh\", \"A Good Man Goes To War\", \"The Wedding of River Song\". We also get \"Doctor Who: Classified\", \"Monster Files\", episode prequels for episodes 1. 3. 7, 8 and 13 which although unnecessary are nice additions to the episodes as well as \"A Christmas Carol\" the annual Christmas episode, comic relief sketch and \"Doctor Who: Confidential-A Night's Tale\" plus deleted scenes for various epiosdes.Although the sixth season has a couple of filler episodes and a few that don't resonante even though the concept is solid enough, the overall story arc for season six is well thought out  and plotted.Recommended.", "term": "\"Come along Pond\"...", "id": "9055:1_0"}, "9056:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I really like this show a lot.

Madoff's and the fictional Mr. Merdle's stories are virtually the same.  See, this is what happens when high finance is left to its own devices:  it ends up cheating to maintain that euphoric 50% return.  But when the pyramid collapses, the economy is left in tatters and lives are ruined.  The 19th century was riddled with financial panics because foxes were guarding the henhouses.  After about a century of these cyclical bubbles, government oversight was firmly established in the 1930s.  Unfortunately, we gradually forgot these lessons and allowed ourselves to be taken in again.  Five years after the collapse, we still haven't recovered.  Read your Dickens, or watch this well-mounted series from the BBC, and relearn those lessons.Financial ups and downs characterize \"Little Dorrit\", as we watch the roller-coaster ride that the Dorrit family takes from riches to rags to riches to rags again.  The story has the usual Dickens ingredients:  noble heroes and heroines, crusty caricatures of servants, exotic supporting players, convoluted plots with unconvincing resolutions.  Along with many 19th century novels, this story displays severe infection from Shakespeare:  quite apart from the convoluted plot with its \"big reveals\" at the end, so characteristic of Shakespeare's \"late romances\" that were particularly popular in the Victorian era (cf. \"Cymbeline\", \"The Winter's Tale\", \"The Tempest\"), the character of the Dorrit patriarch is a none-too-subtle sketch of King Lear, with his three children (two bad, and a third good daughter), his retreat into fantasy to escape harsh realities, his occasional descents into madness.  Somewhat ironic, this, as I had always thought that Tom Courtenay's greatest role was in \"The Dresser\", where he plays an assistant to a mad Albert Finney who plays Lear.  But I think it turns out that his performance here might very well go down as his greatest.  Wow.  I hope he won awards.  Other good performances:  Matthew Macfadyen as the almost ethereal Arthur Clennam.  Clennam is the purest example of the Dickens noble hero, and Macfadyen never hits an inconsistent note, despite temptations offered by the story.  Claire Foy as the eponymous heroine seems unprepossessing and too timid at first, but that's consistent with Dickens' design.  She wears very well, and gathers strength, as things go on.  Judy Parfitt portrays a block of granite excellently.  Eddie Marsan as the hyperactive landlord is amusing, snorting between every word.  One VERY serious blot, though:  Andy Serkis as the murderous villain Rigaud.  Serkis appears to believe that he's playing Gollum again:  getting right up into people's personal space, whispering to them nose-to-nose, caressing their cheeks.  He even climbs up a house at one point:  one is reminded of Mount Doom.  (Does he do this with every role?)  He plays the character in such a repellent manner that it's hard to see how he would be tolerated in any sphere of higher English society, even among dissipated wanna-be young painters.Another blot:  there's a subplot involving an independent young woman who steals a young African companion from another rich family.  It wasn't very good in the novel; here, they try -- unsuccessfully -- to turn it into something else.  After a few episodes, however, they don't even follow up with what they started.  The depiction of this \"Tattycorum\" character and her subplot is far too fraught with 21st century concerns and sensitivities; screenwriter Andrew Davies would've been better advised to axe it altogether.  Miss Wade and Tattycorum are not all that integral to the foundations of the climax, anyway.But, on the whole, a very nice way to spend 8 or 9 hours.  4 out of 5 stars.", "term": "The financial subplot is ruefully applicable to today", "id": "9067:1_0"}, "9068:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "If you're a fan of time period pieces, and/or BBC America, then you will enjoy watching Little Dorrit.

I read a biography on Dickens by an actor-author who claims if writing was Dickens' wife, the theater was Dickens' mistress.  Dickens used to act out many of his books and characters the biography noted.  Dickens' true love was the stage, or theater.  He would go around the country doing readings of his books and act out the characters.  Perhaps that's why his books translate so well to film and the stage.  I actually prefer to watch them, than read his stories.  Especially if they equal the quality of this production.Every scene is exquisite.  The sets, the lighting, the camera angles, the props make early 19th century London come alive.  You want to freeze the frames and study the scene.  The screenplay was written by Andrew Davies who wrote HOUSE OF CARDS and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, the Colin Firth version (1995).  He's working on Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE to be aired on BBC in 2015.But back to LITTLE DORRIT, the acting matches the production's quality.  Speaking of Mr. Darcy, Matthew Macfayden is honorable and virtuous as Arthur Clennam who returns home to find a maid with a mystery in his mother's home.  The maid, Claire Foy, is a dutiful daughter and cares for her father stuck in debtor's prison.  Of course, Dickens wouldn't be Dickens without eccentric and oddball characters who snort and cackle and which are played to the hilt here.

The contrast between the two characters was amazing. Somehow without words Claire Foy as little Amy Dorrit was fearless and brave in the face of Riguad.

He also shows us that people of \"property\" can live in prisons of their own making and be far less happy than those with less money.Dickens is a great reminder that \"pure\" capitalism and a class system which perpetuates it can be nearly as cruel as \"pure\" socialism (Marxism) or any form of dictatorship. Any system which prevents opportunity for all, and stifles the individual, is wrong. It's too bad our governments keep surging towards political extremes and historically have rarely reached any balance - equal economic opportunity for all, with a decent social safety net, only for those who truly need it!

When they released \"Pawn Stars: Volume Three,\" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety.  It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes.  When they released \"American Pickers: Volume Two,\" it was the same thing.  Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two.  I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases.  Personally, I didn't agree with the decision--but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included.  Anyone who read the box knew what to expect--how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Not so for \"American Restoration, Volume One!\"  I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside.  Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package)--it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting.  I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics?  I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information.  My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base.  I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!I, however, will tell you what is inside.  The 2 DVD set has sixteen episodes:  all four from the abbreviated Season One and the first twelve from Season Two.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were sixteen episodes on the DVD box?Season One: (1) Hopalong Rock, (2) Ice Cold, (3) Lights Out, and (4) Buttered Up.Season Two: (1) Cooler Kings, (2) Knockout, (3) Duck and Cover, (4)Pumped Up, (5) Space Kowboy, (6) Jackpot, (7) Safe Keeping, (8) Suck Up, (9) Rev'd Up, (10) Apples and X-Rays, (11) Hot & Cold, and (12) Secret Fan.Actual Review:I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade.  \"American Restoration\" is an offshoot of the popular \"Pawn Stars,\" and fits comfortably into the History Channel's stable of reality based programming.  Its star (Rick Dale) made semi-regular appearances on that program, but now we get a closer look at what he does.  Based in Las Vegas, Dale and team locate objects that might be of value (or represent lost bits of Americana) and figure out ways to restore the item to its former glory.  It's an easy show to like and fascinating especially if you enjoy antiquing or modern day treasure hunting shows (Pawn Stars, Storage Wars and others).  I found it very interesting to see the different techniques of this unusual art form--and I do think Dale is an artist!  The program itself merits four stars.

The summation of the film is this: novice photographer Greg Marinovich (Ryan Phillippe, Flags of Our Fathers) makes a name for himself by going where few would dare to tread--into a Zulu compound--and witnesses the brutal slaying of an outsider. His bold move gets him a spot with The Star newspaper, and soon he is whizzing around South Africa with three other photographers. They spend their days finding all the hot spots and clicking away with their cameras at everything they see. But the more pictures of death and despair they take, the more walled off they get from their emotions and the people around them.There's a fine line between chronicling events and being a part of them; lacking a traditional plot, this dichotomy is what carries the film forward. Greg is present when a man is executed. He tries to stop it, but his protests only make him a target, and he finds himself helpless to do anything but take pictures as the victim is set on fire and then chopped down with a machete. The resulting picture wins him a Pulitzer...and haunts him every day.The other photographers are immersed in the same situation and deal with it in their own ways. Kevin Carter (Taylor Kitsch, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) turns to drugs and alcohol, only to find that they add to his problems instead of alleviating them. He wins his own Pulitzer when he takes a shot of a child apparently being stalked by a vulture, but his joy of winning is quickly tempered by the hordes of people denouncing him for taking pictures instead of helping.Silver does a fantastic job of finding the balance to keep the film moving without dipping into cynicism. Instead, the audience gets to feel the rush of adrenaline that comes from being surrounded by hostile crowds with weapons and a very low tolerance toward outsiders. We understand the need to keep a camera between the horrors being witnessed and the cameraman's soul. The Bang Bang Club is very much a war movie, and just like a soldier who can't afford to think about what he's doing when he's spearing an enemy with a bayonet, the photographers must keep their distance from their surroundings or risk going mad.On the other hand, the audience recognizes the cold-hearted nature of taking a picture of a starving child who's about to become a vulture's dinner and then walking away once the picture is snapped. What this movie does so well is teeter-totter between these opposing mindsets without relieving us of the burdens of either issue.The principal actors are superlative. Phillippe is the weakest of the four, but he also has the longest character arc and the most to do. Frank Rautenbach (Hansie) brings a quiet confidence as Ken Ossterbroek, the leader of the group, and Neels Van Jaarsveld (Goodbye Bafana) plays Joao Silva as alternately terse and spastic. He comes across very much like the real Silva does during the \"Making of\" segment. Kitsch steals the show as the laidback Kevin. His easy smile lights up the screen and he has a smooth, natural charisma that makes him the unconscious focus of every shot he's in. I only wish they had re-created the real Kevin's haunted eyes; Kitsch looks much too bright and innocent for someone who has witnessed his character's life. Casting Director Deirdre Bowen (The Red Violin) deserves a huge heaping of credit for finding this group of relative unknowns, especially since they all look remarkably similar to their real-life counterparts.The secondary characters aren't given more than a quick basecoat characterization. The Star's editor is rumpled and fearful of printing anything too controversial. The photo editor strikes up a relationship with Greg but aside from one \"I can't do this\" scene where she gets a taste of Greg's world, she doesn't really grow. The other photographer's girlfriends are given even shorter shrift; we're told their names, but little else. More's the pity, since the best scene in the film is Viv's response to Joao's proposal.The 1080p 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer comes across well in most cases, with excellent balance. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is good too, although more use could have been made of the surround speakers. I never felt surrounded, even though the photographers often were.The director's commentary is great, full of insight into all aspects of the film and the characters. The forty-five minute \"Making of\" featurette is likewise great, which is a rare treat. The extra not to be missed is the cast and crew interview segment by Kgosi Mongake. There are also deleted scenes, every one of which was a good cut, and a short slideshow of production pictures.-Full review dvdverdict.com", "term": "Powerful and vivid film that will be twisting inside your head for days", "id": "9136:1_0"}, "9137:1_0": {"polarity": "neutral", "sentence": "From a technical perspective, Steven Silver's \"The Bang Bang Club\" is a film that seems easy to love. Filled with grittily realistic action, earnest performances, and a topic that is inherently fascinating and dramatic--this had all the potential in the world. Covering the true story of a notorious group of photojournalists that immersed themselves in war-torn South Africa during the violent post-Apartheid era, these correspondents lived their lives on the front lines as the country unraveled in preparing for free elections. The danger, the pain, the thrills--it was a world unlike any other, but they thrived and excelled in the environment (two won Pulitzer prizes for their photos). But it also took a toll. The moral questions that arise when you report on atrocity but do nothing to stop it is certainly one of the weightier issues that might be explored in a biographical picture of this sort. And yet despite this fantastic source material, Silver's film seems strangely muted and impersonal.Without a doubt, I think this subject matter might have made for one of the most harrowing and powerful films of the year. Ryan Phillippe plays the lead, who begins the narrative as a new freelance photographer to the area. He immediately makes his mark as, against all better judgement, he wanders into a Zulu encampment and captures some incredibly intimate photos from the inside. His recklessness and bravado endear him to an established group of journalists, and they become fast friends. With Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) and Malin Akerman as the other more known names in the cast, everyone does well with the material that they are given--but something is missing. The screenplay never really lets us get close to the protagonists. What a tremendously fascinating group of people, but I still have no idea who they were as individuals. It's an incredibly disappointing oversight--because by remaining distant from the characters, the film lacks the devastating impact that would have made it unforgettable.Kitsch gets some of the film's more effective emotional moments, and is surprisingly convincing. Phillippe never really alters his demeanor and, without any character insight, tends to come across as one note. The other two members of the Bang Bang Club (as they became nicknamed in the press) are likable enough but are never developed with any sort of intimacy. You really want to understand these guys--what drove them into this life and this world and sustained them. But the film maintains a hands-off approach to any psychological exploration. The movie is about the club and, yet, they remain aloof. I wanted to know more and I wanted to love this movie! But the lack of character development and insight diminishes the film's power. Still worth seeing, particularly if you have an interest in the topic, the movie might have been a devastating must-see for adult audiences. As is, it is a rather impersonal (but well made) document of the times.

As an amateur photographer with dreams of being a photo journalist, this film hits home but at the same time, and much like in the film City of God, it brings to light the tragedies a photographer must face in violent and volatile situations.  The dangers are real and a combat or high-risk photographer must accept those dangers and the toll the images they attempt to capture have on the world, the subjects, and themselves.  This film shows much of this effectively.I believe many think that The Bang Bang Club is supposed to be about the last days of Apartheid in South Africa as seen through the eyes of four photographers.  In fact, and being that the story was written by the two remaining members of the club, it is about four photographers who just so happen to be covering this world changing story from 1990 to 1994.  This is because, the story is supposed to be about the photographers.  For once instead of their images being the center of attention, in this case they are and it is not necessarily meant to bring awareness of Apartheid - well into the 21st century, the world is already aware of the atrocities in South Africa due to the policy meant to subjugate an entire group of people.  It is about these four photographers and indeed about all photographers that put their lives, psyche, and the nature of being human on the line.

It is based on the book of one of them; Greg Marinovich (Ryan Phillippe - `54', `Cruel Intentions' and `The Lincoln Lawyer'). Greg was a freelance but managed to get taken seriously by getting up close and personal with the warring sides. The ANC were in a civil war with the `Authorities' who were being helped by the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Movement. Atrocities were being perpetrated by both sides, but the press was very much on the side of the ANC and working to strict censorship from the ruling white government. Greg went out of his way to hear what Inkatha ha to say - and show him, it is not all pleasant.We follow the fortunes of Greg and one of the more laid back members of the `gang', Kevin Carter (Taylor Kitsch) who has a penchant for recreational cigarettes and an excellent eye for a good photo. Greg also falls for the Photo Editor - Robin Comley (Malin Akerman) something which she says she never does. In one scene as they enter a bar there is a poster that proclaims, `A Civil War s not Very Relaxing', well we soon find out why. There are graphic scenes of violence, with extensive use of machetes and not a lot being left to the imagination. There is real tension throughout and loads of extras involved in the street and ghetto fighting. Writer and director Steven Silver has done an excellent job to try to recreate the actions that took place and are both from the book and the actual original photos.The film tracks mainly the four year period between 1990 and 1994 and for the most part does so as observer with an interloper feel. The question of `when do you intervene', is finally addressed, but to say any more would be a plot spoiler for those not familiar with what took place. I always find that some photographers of death and suffering are almost indecent voyeurs, however; the fear and passion that is needed to do such work is brilliantly captured. It is always easier for the casual observer to be critical of such actions, when they have not actually done the deed themselves.This is an excellent piece of cinema that has brought to the screen an essential piece of African recent history, if you are interested in that period then this is a must see.

Stop me if you've seen this before: Cartman takes something to a whacky extreme, and when people see how depraved/whacky he is, they just stare at him with their mouths agape while he keeps doing his song and dance.

In the first couple seasons it was less slanted at being a parody of the world now and more focused on the boys being boys, as well as having a sly commentary on the side, now it's just all political commentary.

Due to its viral-video success, Comedy Central picked up the rights to the franchise and aired the first episode of the adult animated series in 1997.  The cartoon garnered fame as one of the first shows to hinge its comedy on the use of crude language, satirical storylines, and dark humor.  Set in South Park, Colorado, the main characters of the show--Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick--often parody the childhoods of their writers.SPECIAL FEATURES of the Season 15 box-set include deleted scenes, \"6 Days to Air:  The Making of `South Park,'\" \"6 Days to Air:  Behind the Scenes of `City Sushi,'\" and \"Commentary-Mini.\"  If you have never watched the episodes with \"Commentary Mini,\" I encourage you to do so; the short commentaries from Trey Parker and Matt Stone are optionally run during the first three minutes of each episode.  Parker and Stone have used this method of commentary since the early seasons.  Their short introductions often expose insights behind particular jokes, further multiplying the laugh count.SEASON 15 kicked off in the spring of 2011 with fourteen episodes, each written during the week before broadcast.  In true \"South Park\" style, some of the pop-culture references of this season include:  The Royal Wedding, the History Channel, \"The Matrix,\" U.S./Mexico Border Security, DeVry University, Wiki-Leaks, Steve Jobs/Apple, Asperger's Syndrome, Broadway Theater, \"The Human Centipede,\" Comedy Central's First Annual Comedy Awards, the NCAA, Veganism, and the War on Wall Street.  I have been a fan of \"South Park\" since its beginning and religiously purchase each season; however, I feel that the show's wit and charm has been in a slump since season 14.  While I still find the show highly entertaining, much of the recent comedy has felt `forced.'  I am happy to say that the writing seems to pick back up in Season 16 and is nearly fully-operational by Season 17.EPISODES:  In the middle of the 15th Season, the episode \"You're Getting Old\" gave the implication to many viewers that Stone and Parker may have used the plot as an allegory for expressing their feelings about the direction of the \"South Park\" series.  Because the later seasons failed to impress long-time viewers, the fear of an impending end to \"South Park\" only gained steam.  By the end of Season 15, Comedy Central had announced an extension to Stone and Parker's contract which promises to carry the series into 2016 (Season 20), thus subsiding the worry of dedicated fans.Episode 1:  \"HUMANCENTiPAD\"--When Cartman doesn't get the iPad he has been bragging about, he starts a campaign against his mother; Kyle fails to iTunes updates before agreeing to them.Episode 2:  \"Funnybot\"--Jimmy names the Germans as the world's least funny people during the school Comedy Awards; Germany retaliates by producing a funny robot.Episode 3:  \"Royal Pudding\"--Canadians around the world tune in to watch the royal marriage, as is tradition.  But when the new princess is kidnapped, Canada is left in a state of chaos... as is tradition.Episode 4:  \"T.M.I.\"--When the school posts the students' height differentials, Cartman misinterprets the `objects' measured.Episode 5:  \"Crack Baby Athletic Association\"--Cartman exploits the entertainment quality of crack-babies, creating a lucrative business venture the Kyle cannot resist.Episode 6:  \"City Sushi\"--Big-Rig Butters, Inspector Butters, Marjorine, Professor Chaos, and Leopold Stotch are discovered to have a single unifying quality:  Butters.  To avoid being grounded, Butters must sort out his multiple personality disorder.Episode 7:  \"You're Getting Old\"--Stan becomes more cynical with age leading to a breakup with Kyle.  Sharon and Randy separate so Randy can pursue his dreams as `Steamy Ray Vaughn.'Episode 8:  \"Azz Burgers\"--Due to an onset of antisocial behavior, Stan is believed to have Asperger's Syndrome.

Likely until the series ends. Still, these last two seasons have found my interests shift, not that I don't love the show and respect Matt and Trey as much as I always have, but priorities change and like Stan, I fear I'm getting old. There's something poetic about Stan only turning 10 and my having found this show when it started airing right as I turned 10. While I'll always follow this unique trailblazing show these last two seasons have found me picking up a lot of the episodes after initial airing due to life circumstances. Many times I forgot a new episode was on or that the new season had started. That said, when I found time to watch the episodes I enjoyed the majority of them.I will say this is a standout season from recent years. Many episodes this season follow the series' best of formulas, they aren't one-off episodes as much as they are a cumulative effort. A lot of quality ideas tossed together in a blender with some weirdness and some abstractness. You know what you have when you do that? You have yourself that classic South Park we all love. It's a shame not every episode can capture that old fresh charm the show once had but shows have to evolve and viewers change/desensitize. In the end this is a season worth owning for anyone who is still a fan or for those who possibly grew up on this more recent evolution of South Park. The purchase for those individuals is made even easier to justify given that they've included the insightful, and hilarious, documentary \"6 Days to air: The Making of South Park\". I actually think that is a highlight of this set along with the Getting Old/A$$ Burgers episodes.So what exactly are you getting yourself into with this season? Well, \"frrrp, dee derp frrrp\". But I'll break it down in a simpler fashion. 14 Uncensored (Yes Actually Uncensored this time) episodes:HUMANCENTiPADKyle doesn't know what he's signed himself up for when he agrees to iTUNES latest terms of service and user agreement. This episode perfectly mocks apple, social networking and the low budget horror film about a human centipede. Some people I know thought it missed the mark but I think they were unaware of the HC reference.FunnybotGermans create a robot that plans to take comedy to its logical extreme, global annihilation. Jimmy and Tyler Perry must save the day. To me the funniest part of the episode was Token being unable to keep a straight face at Tyler Perry. \"Oh Lor-awd!\"Royal PuddingMatt and Trey have always loved Terrence, Philip and the Canadians more than their general audience. So an entire episode about mocking the Royal Wedding with Canadian characters probably didn't sit well with most American viewers. As a Canadian I likely found it more enjoyable than I imagine they did, you know what I mean, eh there buddy-guy!T.M.I.When Cartmen believes the school has posted the boys wiener sizes he freaks and lands in anger management, soon after Randy joins him and they start a riot and the form a political party with demands for the government. A simple concept that I found enjoyable, the notion that all anger management is correlated with small manhood size may have some merit.Crack Baby Athletic AssociationKyle gets roped into Cartmen's new racket of helping crack babies by making them play basketball and raking in profits. I'm told, and it seems to be a commentary on the NCAA but I don't know enough about that to say anything meaningful. I know the episode all started from wanting to mock those commercials with the sad Sarah McLachlan song and I now know that Slash may or may not be real, but he is definitely a feeling in your heart.City SushiButters is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and the City Wok guy deals with new competition in town (and within himself). I found the idea of Butters being diagnosed MPD for playing pretend to be funny, then the idea that his therapist is the real sick person really topped it off nicely. I wonder, do younger fans appreciate the Psycho reference at the end as much as older ones? I liked it.You're Getting Old (1)Stand turns 10 and everything looks and sounds like crap to him. This episode, as mentioned, sparked a great deal of interest in the show again. Leaving off on a potential cliffhanger and actual serious moment like the show had never really seen. This episode will hit so close to home with many fans of the series, it sums up not just the majority of thoughts on the series itself, but a true aspect of growing up.Ass Burgers (2)Stan's negative attitude might be the result of a mild form of autism. Meanwhile Cartmen and Kyle start selling burgers of a special variety. This episode was hilarious. \"If there really were a social developmental disease you wouldn't call it ass burgers, that's, that's just mean\". Unfortunately for me this episode is funny and comes up with a resolution to the last episode that seems fitting but the continuing storyline will end here. The answer to all life's problems seems to be becoming an alcoholic.The Last of the MeheecansA game turns Butters into the last Meheecan (or Mexican). Cartmen becomes a boarder patrol guard as Butters travels to Mexico and a lot of the stupidity regarding the hysteria over illegal immigration is mocked.Bass to MouthA new gossip website is posting about the students at South Park elementary. The funniest thing here is that nobody cares until a post effects them and then they are all on board. Also nice to see Lemmiwinks return to take down his rival Wikileaks.Broadway Bro DownRandy learns the secret rewards of taking you wife to a musical and decides to write his own. A good episode that satirizes the Broadway scene, or 'Brod Way' in this case. All this is obviously on account of Matt and Trey's huge success with their own broadway hit, The Book of Mormon. It's fun to see the guys get to satirize something you know they've been wanting to.History Channel ThanksgivingA history channel documentary leads the boys astray in regards to Thanksgiving and Natalie Portman's wormhole must be opened. A nice satirizing of how pointless and speculative the supposed history channel has become and the movie Thor among other things. This was a good episode that is sure to become a Thanksgiving classic.1%Cartmen's screw ups in phys. ed wind up finding all the other students being punished for his failings. Then they all gang up against him. A relevant episode that satirized and mocked the whole OWS movement in a classic South Park fashion.Poor KidKenny's parents get taken away for shouting loudly and Cartmen doesn't know who to rip on for being poor anymore. Mysterion makes a welcome appearance and the concept of parents not being allowed to parent anymore is well explored. This was a well done finale for the season and if the giant reptilian bird at the end through some for a loop, think back to the agnostic foster parents speech.So there you have it. I think some people have stopped caring about the show as much after Comedy Central seemed to castrate it by foolishly censoring the 200&201 episodes last season, even on DVD/Blu-ray. I still and always will have a soft spot for this series. I may not keep up with the new episodes like I used to but it doesn't seem the show is going away just yet (3 more seasons) and I can always catch up on Blu-ray if I start missing the episodes altogether. I do hope that when the show does end Matt and Trey will find a way to give it a fitting end, obviously not a resolution exactly (there can't be one to a series like this) but something hilarious or shocking enough that it encapsulates the true spirit of the series. There would be no Animation Domination without this series. As much as people can say this series was possible only because of the Simpsons opening the door, none of the recent animated comedies would have been possible without South Park being the first ones to really push the boundaries, break down some more doors and punch some people in the face. This series truly founded adult oriented animated series'.I'll be buying this season because I loved the getting old episode and enjoyed most of the others in this batch. I always enjoy Matt and Trey's mini-commentaries. Then there is the great documentary I've already discussed which is included as a special feature along with behind the scenes of City Sushi and some deleted scenes. I felt slightly compelled by Stan and others getting old who see everything as crap to give this season only 4 stars. But in re-watching it before this review I have to say it is a marked improvement over other recent years with only the usual debatable misstep or two. The second half is especially solid.I opened with a rephrased quote from the season and another one seems to fit adequately in regards to my purchasing decision, lol:\"Is this season worth owning?

This perfectly pleasant presentation is far from perfect and yet it has plenty to recommend it as well. So, with no other reviews, I felt compelled to chime in with the middle ground and present a few pros and cons of the miniseries. To rate this at the five star level indicating that it is at the top echelon of quality might seem to set unreasonable expectations. While nice, this is hardly on the level of the original \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" or the sublime recent version of \"Bleak House.\" Everything can't be five stars or the classification loses any meaning! Conversely, even if you don't particularly care for the program--there are many solid elements (especially the performances) that would elevate it beyond a dismissive one star. So here I am, standing squarely in the middle--at about 3 1/2 stars rounded up for three very convincing actors (a strong Anna Maxwell-Martin, the always reliable David Morrissey, and the increasingly entertaining Penelope Wilton).If this three part miniseries is guilty of anything, it is of having too much story to compress into its limited timeframe. Ostensibly the tale covers an entire town's worth of characters and story lines and three episodes is not adequate time to present them in an in-depth way. The heart of the story involves a local girl (Maxwell-Martin) returning to South Riding to take up a position as the school mistress. Headstrong and independent, she immediately clashes with some of more traditional town leaders--including Morrissey. You know immediately where this battle of wills is headed, but credit the writer and actors for maintaining a credible conflict without an easy resolution. This is, by far, the most intriguing aspect of the story as Morrissey is haunted by an unresolved relationship in his life. Maxwell-Martin may be a little progressive and modern for this tiny 1930's village, but she plays with a wide eyed conviction that keeps you on her side.The story, however, also extends to subplots about an illicit affair, a land grab scheme, an impoverished girl making good, unrequited attraction and a number of other narrative elements battling for screen time. The talented supporting cast is very much underserved by the script that has little time or interest to develop them beyond the most superficial qualities. As such, much of the drama and impact of \"South Riding\" is limited. The second episode is probably the most engaging with the Maxwell-Martin and Morrissey pairing being explored at length. But even that plot point comes to an abrupt end. The complicated and overstuffed plot points, however, all come to tidy conclusions in a rushed ending filled with pat solutions and cliched narration.For its faults, though, this is still a handsome production filled with terrific actors. I'm glad I watched it, and I found it entertaining and pleasurable. Is it the best that BBC or Masterpiece Theater has to offer? Not even close! But if you enjoy this type of entertainment, this show has its share of charm even if it's not particularly substantive. A good effort that simply has too much going on and, thus, leaves the viewer wanting more story and character development.

I was drawn in by the premise of an independent and intelligent young woman making her way in the world, and hoping to inspire young women at an all-girls' high school to attain greater heights. The setting is 1930s Yorkshire, and Anna Maxwell Martin plays the role of Sarah Burton, a strong-willed and fiercely opinionated young woman who returns to her small town of South Riding to apply for the post of headmistress at an all-girls' school. Though she lands the job, she finds that many people in the town are not as open to changes as she had hoped for, even if this means a brighter, better future for her students.One of Sarah's strongest critics is landowner Robert Carne (David Morrissey who first impressed me by his performance as Colonel Brandon in Sense & Sensibility (with Miss Austen Regrets  BBC TV 2008), a single parent with a young, highly excitable daughter, Midge (Katherine McGolpin). Robert finds Sarah's opinions a bit too modern and highly idealistic, but he himself is battling desperate economic times, and gets behind on his mortgage payments. Robert also has a dark secret concerning his wife, Muriel (Lydia Wilson) and their history is reflected through numerous flashbacks to the past.One of the strengths of this drama was the development in the relationship between Sarah and Robert, and the strong chemistry between the two leads made the love-hate relationship appear credible as viewers see mutual dislike give way to grudging respect and affection. These two characters were very well-developed, yet many others in the drama were not as well explored. One in particular was the role of Sarah's admirer, a quiet Scottish barrister, Joe Astell, played by Douglas Henshall. Both Sarah and Joe get along famously, but it is evident from the beginning that Joe has a thing for Sarah, yet she acts as if she is oblivious to this, something which I found difficult to believe. I would have liked to see more of Joe, and discover his life and background, and what made him come to South Riding in the first place.I felt one of the main weaknesses in this production was the insufficient development of many of the secondary characters. The production had a rushed feel to it, and this is particularly evident in the final episode, where events careen at a rapid rate, and where everything is presumably neatly tied up, but viewers are left feeling disappointed and let-down, with many questions left unanswered. I'm guessing that budget may be the cause for this, as the story had enough in it to have made several more episodes possible.

We know them only by their first names, Kalle, Johanna and Thomas. Although this film was given the unfortunate name, Troll Hunter, it is primarily a disturbing educational experience. Some of what a viewer sees might seem unnecessarily bloody and frightening, but this is what these students found after they attached themselves to a reclusive, surly bear hunter. I will only say that this man, Hans, and his superior, Mr. Finn Haugen, worked for the Norwegian Wildlife Board. As we and the students later learn the men actually were employees of the secret government agency, the Norwegian Troll Security Service (TSS). This agency, it turned out, was created to kill trolls and hide their existence. Outlandish? You must watch this documentary film. This film was released only after the students disappeared and their work was discovered by the side of a road.The film is presented as it was discovered, from snips and pieces made by the students. Kalle was the cameraman, Johanna was responsible for the audio, Thomas was the on-camera commentator. We do not know their last names, only that they were students from Dottmar College. They were three young people dedicated to their project, sometimes frightened but with a deep desire to learn and to record the truth. They have never been seen again, and we do not know their fate. Many suspect the TSS might be involved since it since has been learned that the TSS has been attempting to cover-up the existence of trolls for many years. This was discovered only inadvertently when the Norwegian prime minister, Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, inadvertently confirmed the existence of trolls during a press conference.In the course of these students' film we encounter the Tosserlad, the Jotnar and a group of young Ringlefinches, all huge beasts with gigantic noses, long arms and covered with filthy hair. We see how gigantic are these beasts, towering over forests and wreaking destruction as they move. We learn that their inability to convert vitamin D into calcium makes them vulnerable to turning into stone in sunlight as their bodies over-react to UV rays. Unfortunately, (because of the likelihood of sensationalism), the students also record terrifying chases through dense dark woods, bloody encounters and frightening suspense. There is the sacrifice of a goat to snare, I believe, a ringlefinch. The young goat bleats its fear.Some of what the students filmed simply is not appropriate for children. Indeed, even the preparations for approaching these creatures might seem too disgusting for family viewing. The application of trollstench, particularly to the armpits and groins, is vulgar. This substance is so foul to the nostrils that gagging usually is induced. Trollstench is prepared by cooking down the difficult-to-collect bodily wastes of trolls. This, however, is essential if one is to disguise one's own scent, particularly if one is a Christian. Trolls are enraged by Christians. Yet as fearsome as these huge beasts are, they are susceptible to disease. This might be, the students learn, the cause of troll rage.Kalle, Johanna and Thomas framed their story around Hans, the trolljegeren (or troll hunter). Hans might not be as reliable as the students think. Yet Hans undoubtedly knows his trollsCall Troll Hunter what you will - a documentary, cinema verite, or simply a student college film project. It remains a remarkable record. Any who have managed to watch that other classic documentary, Forgotten Silver, will not regret watching this.", "term": "Three dedicated Norwegian students create a fine documentary", "id": "9207:1_0"}, "9208:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Mockumentaries seem to have worn out their welcome just as much as unnecessary remakes have in recent years. There have been countless fake documentaries out there that chronicle \"real\" events or try to come off as feeling more authentic by using this technique. The Blair Witch Project, REC, Borat, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, Cloverfield, Diary of the Dead, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, I'm Still Here, and Paranormal Activity are just a few examples that come to mind. It's become a really monotonous concept as of late since all of the films that decide to go this route all seem to follow the same formula. Trollhunter is a bit different though. It at least feels like its pushing the boundaries of what mockumentaries are truly capable of.Three college students are sent to investigate some rather unorthodox bear killings, but eventually come to realize they've bitten off more than they can chew. Their investigation leads them to Hans (Otto Jespersen), who is believed to be a poacher trying to capitalize on the success of all the bear hunters in Norway. The students are adamant about getting an interview with Hans and follow the mysterious man as he comes and goes at odd hours of the day and stays out all night. While trailing him one night, Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud); one of the students, is bitten by something as we finally get a glimpse of what Hans really hunts; trolls. Hans eventually caves and allows the students to tag along with him as he shows us a world the government is going to elaborate lengths to cover up.Trollhunter has gone to great lengths to at least appear like a lot of thought went into how these trolls exist in the real world. Whether a lot of time went into that or not, the parts of the film where that information is given to us is easily the most intriguing aspect of the film. Everything from how UV rays affect them, whether they'll explode or turn to stone, the various different types of trolls, why some have multiple heads, and what power lines are really put up for are all things touched upon in the film. It is probably a bit unrealistic on one hand, but if you grew up reading Grimm's Fairy Tales or are a fan of fantasy in general, then it's something you'll easily find yourself getting absorbed into.While the film does a good job of latching onto your interest, Trollhunter does kind of feel like it rushes in the troll department a bit. We see several different types of trolls; a Tosserlad, Ringlefinch, Mountain Kings, and the Jotnar. But you're left wanting more of these adventures of close encounters with these enormous fantastical creatures, which is probably better than wanting less of them. Everything we see relating to the trolls is incredible, but it seems like none of those scenes last anywhere near as long as anything building up to them. At one point in the film, Thomas mentions something about them currently standing where many troll battles take place. Mountain trolls and woodland trolls apparently come to blows there, throw rocks at each other, and basically just have an all out war. That would've been amazing to actually see.With that said, the troll scenes are still very impressive. The real gems are the Tosserlad and the Jotnar since they are the ones with the most screen time. The night vision camera along with the chase in the woods and how Hans subdues the creature are what make the Tosserlad experience so exciting. The Jotnar is almost overwhelming due to its size and it manages to deliver some of the most astounding scenes in the film. The main one being Hans trying to get in front of the Jotnar by driving right underneath its feet while it's walking only to be struck by its massive right hand. That scene makes the whole mockumentary technique payoff.Trollhunter is not meant to be terrifying and it more than likely won't make you cry from laughing too hard. It is, however, a thought provoking and fascinating dark fantasy film. Whether the appearance of the trolls appeals to you or not is entirely up to you, but they are presented fairly realistically on film. The amount of detail that goes into what they eat, how they act, and why they're being hunted is what keeps you intrigued in-between the brief, although rather spectacular, altercations between the human characters and the trolls. Trollhunter puts a unique spin on what was otherwise thought to be a worn out concept and leaves you wanting more by the time it's all over, which is all any film should really aspire to do.Special features on the DVD are a bit misleading. Mostly because it looks like there's a ton, but most of them fall in between being only thirty seconds to three minutes in length. There are five Deleted Scenes that last about three and a half minutes total and aren't really all that important or interesting. Improv and Bloopers is two minutes in length and has three scenes. Extended Scenes is where it starts to get interesting. Nearly eight minutes in length, three scenes from the film are a bit longer and contain some fascinating tidbits here and there. Visual Effects is really cool. Three featurettes show how most of the trolls and other CG animated creatures (sheep, Hans in his sample extracting suit) are built from the ground up. This is all about six minutes in length. Behind the Scenes is probably the most vital special feature to watch. You get a good look at how much of the film was computer generated and how much was actually built on set. It's incredible how actors are able to react to things that aren't physically there with them to this extent. Behind the Scenes is spread out amongst seven featurettes and is about twenty three minutes long. Photo Galleries is mostly a look at troll sketches and they're habitats while HDNet: A Look at Trollhunter is mainly the cast talking about the film in between clips of the film itself. These features are around six minutes and four minutes respectively. So you get a total of about fifty three minutes of bonus features.Trollhunter is rated PG-13 for some sequences of creature terror, is available in both English and Norwegian 5.1 Dolby Digital with English or Spanish subtitles, and presented in a widescreen 1.78:1 aspect ratio. It is approximately 103 minutes long.

The troll issue is kept from the public though, and it is only by chance that a young student film crew stumbles on the one man who is charged with keeping trolls on the reservation. The troll hunter named Hans is played by actor Otto Jespersen, with a cool, calm reserve that helps hold viewers attention.  Hans seems to have an agenda, but it's never quite clear what it is.  After combating (and occasionally massacring) the trolls, he breaks the government's silence, and lets the hapless college kids follow him and film what happens.The filmmakers balance elements of comedy and horror, and skillfully underplay their hand - they know audiences have already seen similar films (Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, etc.) so they don't rely to much on the \"documentary\" gag. Similarly, they judiciously withhold the special effects so that they don't get old. They also don't make them too groovy -- the trolls look both amazingly and comedically weird, just weird enough that you think, \"they look just like illustrations from an old fairy tale - what if \"real\" trolls really looked like cartoon figures?\"  They also inject just enough tragedy and tension tht the film doesn't feel like a joke.  If the premise sounds good, you'll probably enjoy the movie and it's slowly-unfolding narrative and inconclusive ending. Also, the filmmakers seem to have positioned themselves for both a prequel and sequels... I wouldn't be surprised to see a comic book come out of this as well.

This film kept me engaged for most of the time, due to the subject matter and the skillful integration of the CGI. The characters, if you suspend belief (this is not meant to be real, after all) are likeable and, well, believable,  and although not much time is spent fleshing them out, still do a nice job. I grew up listening to and later finding my own collections of fairy tales, so this was not much of a stretch for me, minus the incredibly large troll that dwarfed the landscape. That particular one I couldn't imagine being secret for long, although admittedly the maps of Norway do show sparse population centers in much of the area. All in all it was an interesting modern take on what the film called a wild population of indigenous creatures, and the &#34;conservationists in charge of them. Or more specifically from the dialog: wild animals, and the hunters that kept them in check. There was a scene or two that dragged, but once the trolls came out to play, it got interesting. Decent film, not a waste of time- and watchable by children.

They want to get their story and are overjoyed when it turns out to be bigger than they expected. Even when things get hairy they stick with it. And the hunter is something himself. He's weary (which is why he lets them tag along) and might just want to get all this over with. He's been doing it too long. He's \"on\" all the time. No home base. No days off. No vacations. Just the day in, day out drudgery. The story unfolds at an even pace and it makes sense given the circumstances. Being that the viewer enters things at the same time as the students they learn all about Trolls, and their dealings, at the same time.

Clutch writing makes the characters as interesting as the monsters--a task which I feel is generally difficult.The movie opens with a mood-setting disclaimer that it was formed by chronologically assembling footage left behind by an anti-Mythbusters documentary film crew from the University of Volda.  How very Norse-Blair Witch Project meets Cloverfield of them.  The camerawork has all of the appeal of Cloverfield without the headache-inducing shakiness (except when briefly appropriate, for example, running from a troll!).This film follows a group of student filmmakers as they follow Hans.  Originally suspected of being a bear poacher, Hans is actually a somewhat bitter, poorly paid government employee charged with \"troll management\".  This sounds slapstick-ridiculous, but I swear it is delivered with a straight face.  Hans is charged with tracking and killing trolls that have wandered from their government-delineated territory--like a secret wildlife preserve.  He hopes that filming these creatures and informing the public could improve future troll management strategies...that, and he's clearly sick of the secrecy and, perhaps, being under-appreciated.The depictions of the trolls stayed in the true spirit of classic folklore.  But still there was a subtle attempt to explain a bit about troll biology.  As a biologist, I found this charming.  The extra heads (accessory organs, really) that some trolls develop throughout their life cycle assist them in peacocking to impress females and to intimidate other trolls.  There are also two species (groups), each with various subspecies (types), of trolls.  In as detailed a manner as one could expect from a movie like this, they even explain why trolls turn to stone when exposed to ultraviolet light (and why some explode instead).  Troll detection, tracking, various baiting techniques, gestation periods, intelligence, and the simple fact that they are mammals are all addressed, even if only briefly.The behavior and variety of the trolls they encounter make this film feel like Where the Wild Things Are for fanboys.  There are several different troll scenes and the types of trolls differ as much as the circumstances of their encounter.  While the effects are not amazing, they are every bit as good as they need to be to maintain the credibility of a world in which trolls exist and, more importantly, to keep us entertained.  I never felt that the effects \"could have been better\".  If you like monster movies then this is a MUST SEE for you!I you like this movie, then check out Rare Exports and Thale.

It is written and directed by Andr&eacute; vredal, a name to keep an eye on for sure.  Here is a film that works with a modest budget and takes an absolutely absurd concept and somehow forces it through as realistic a lens as possible.  Sure, it's easy now to just brush off these mokumentary movies as gimmicks, because there have been quite a few of them fromMan Bites DogtoThe Blair Witch Projectand to the more recentQuarantine(or the superior movie[Rec] that it was based on).  There have been misses of course with this method but more often than not its use has been effective in making a scenario seem more authentic and the horror of it all the more compelling and enjoyable.  I'm past believing the mokumentary set-up is hackneyed now.  It seems to me a very legitimate way of making movies seem more real, especially in an age where computerized images dominate big budget Hollywood pictures and unwittingly request that real cinephiles stretch our suspension of disbelief well beyond at least my own comfort zone.  So I'm a proponent of the possibilities of the mokumentary horror film after watching this little gem that contains all the elements to make every frame fun and believable.  It is particularly highlighted by Otto Jespersen's Hans; the film's title role.  His dead pan demeanor and casual actions in bizarrely twisted situations bring a welcome dry humor that had me chuckling regularly as I enjoyed The Troll Hunter.  Jespersen offers up a Bill Murray-like performance in a role that is clearly not written for a comedian, but is most definitely and quite potently delivered by one.  He is terrific in this movie.A group of naive student journalists sets out to track down and document a supposed bear poacher.  This is Hans (Jespersen) and he is very reluctant to respond to their inquiries about his activities.  They follow Hans all over Western Norway until they finally discover what he is really doing.  After they figure this out he lets them follow and film him as he goes about his unique occupation.  The moment when the students know for sure what Hans is really up to will test your imagination or make you laugh hysterically, or maybe even a little bit of both.  At that moment I wasn't really sure what I was watching but I knew one thing; I loved it.The natural performances by the rest of the cast are not to be overlooked.  These are talented young actors that help make the film much more than a simple one trick monster movie.  The Troll Hunter should also be commended for being shot on location in the mountains of Western Norway.  It couldn't have been an easy shoot for anyone but again it lends itself in an attempt to make an off-the-wall concept filmmable and compelling.

Pretty fast, they will discover that in reality he hunts a game infinitely more dangerous and exotic than bears and also that he works for a secret agency of Norwegian government. At that moment the courageous trio decides to discover all the truth about this shady organisation.This film is an excellent comedy, even if on the surface of things everything is treated with the greatest seriousness. We progressively learn a lot about trolls and even more about people in charge of control of their population and movements. Some moments are purely irresistible, but my absolute favourite is the visit in a very powerful electric plant in the middle of nowhere and the conversations with its crew...)))

These are movies that present a story using hand held camera footage that was supposed to have been lost but then rediscovered and can now be shown to the public. Some work (like THE LAST EXORCISM) and others don't (too many). TROLL HUNTER works and works well.This Norwegian film begins with a group of students shooting a film that's supposed to be about poachers and hunters killing bears in the nearby forest. The problem is that once they arrive and see the bear that's been killed, they know this wasn't normal nor was it done by hunters. Seeing a man off to himself, they begin to follow him. Rumor has it that he is a troll hunter, those fabled creatures found in fairy tales.The group follows him around and pesters him until he finally allows them to go with him in his travels. He drops hints to them that there are indeed trolls roaming the various forests but that the government does all it can to keep this fact unknown to the world. Of course the kids think he's full of it but play along thinking they can get an interesting movie out of it. They get more than they bargained for.One night after he leaves them behind to set a series of troll traps, he suddenly comes back and tells them to sit still and be quiet. He continues to ask them if any of them are Christians to which they always respond no. It seems that trolls have an aversion to Christians and can smell them out.As the group sits and jokes, oblivious to his warnings to be quiet, they see something shaking the trees in the distance. Soon they can see what it is when they come face to face with a giant troll breaking through the branches. Running for their lives with the troll in pursuit, it is the troll hunter who rescues them when they reach his vehicle, equipped with lights that freeze the troll until morning when the sunlight turns him to stone.Here is where the film changes, becoming a quest for the group to document the reality that trolls do indeed exist and the cover up being initiated by the government to keep people unaware. It seems that the trolls have been given a substantial piece of land where they are to remain but recently have begun to cross over. One can only imagine if an army of these giants were to cross their border. Only the troll hunter keeps them in line.This movie works on so many levels. As a \"lost footage\" true story film that turns once we glimpse the trolls (not that I would believe in them to being with). When the trolls make an appearance we find ourselves in another world where fairy tale creatures exist and few can hold them back. Rather than a movie about someone whose mind is lost that believes in trolls, we find ourselves believing as well.The acting involved (don't expect names because I'm nearly certain no one would recognize them anyway) is well played with each actor making us believe they are this group of youngsters who find themselves in way over their heads. And the actor portraying the grizzled troll hunter does a remarkable job as the worn out man who must see to it they're contained.The special effects are remarkable with stony giants come to life on the big screen. These aren't the lumbering creatures that perhaps a Harryhausen might have made 40 years ago, these are fast moving creations that would rush after you with little hope of escape.The movie is vastly entertaining, taking its time to unwind and allow the story to unfold. Its not the normal jump into the creature 5 minutes into the film. We get to know the characters first, to witness their motivations and beliefs before we get to the trolls.

A group of three Norwegian university students, Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna Mrck), and cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), create a documentary about Hans (Otto Jespersen), whom they believe is poaching bears, only to discover he is hunting much larger game.What they unearth is a grand conspiracy to keep trolls from the general public. Early on, the intrepid troll hunter decides to share everything, and in doing so reveals a few important rules: 1) trolls are like gorillas, humanoid animals, 2) they can smell the blood of a Christian man, 3) they will eat anything. These lessons are demonstrated in graphic fashion as Hans takes on each of the different types of trolls in their natural habitat, ranging from under bridges to cavern lairs.Troll Hunter has an explanation for everything, ranging from their vulnerability to sunlight to how they're kept under wraps.  There's even a Norwegian government agency conspiracy, the Troll Security Service (TSS), dedicated to covering it all up.  The trolls are bad enough; government goons are an even greater threat.The trolls are beautifully rendered in CGI that would probably not stand up to scrutiny under a wide angle lens.  But the small camera the university students use conceals many flaws, which makes the trolls all the more terrifying.  Although Troll Hunter strives heroically to have the trolls make sense, it sticks to its guns on making trolls giant, hirsute, lumpy creatures with big noses and tails. They are paintings come to life.Hans, a war veteran, has a fatalistic air about him as he pursues these trolls, and we get the sense that he is looking for a way out of a profession for which there is no retirement.  As the trolls become more aggressive he seeks larger and larger prey, until eventually he finds his Moby Dick in a Jotnar, which towers over two hundred feet tall.Troll Hunter's biggest flaw is its character development.  When the university students witness a death at the hand of a troll, they are sporadically concerned - no explanation is given for why they don't just call the authorities, give up, or mourn their friend properly.  Half the time they seem to think the entire thing is a big joke, even after one of them is mauled by a troll. They seem to have no plan for the revolutionary footage they record and, despite repeated threats by TSS agents, stubbornly stick to a near suicidal course of action. These are idiots asking to be eaten.That said, they didn't name this film Stupid Student Hunter.  It's all about the trolls and Troll Hunter delivers in spades.

It's definitely not a horror movie, nor a thriller.. it's not scary, unless you are a complete wuss that is afraid of your own shadow, and the re-invention of Trolls as large monsters that the Norwegian Government don't want people to know about is just plain silly.::Plot::3 College kids are out and about looking for something to film, as they haven't got much else better to do. They find a town where there is a dead bear that has supposedly been shot, but some of the people they interview beleive it was not shot, as no one has laid claim to the kill, and tracks around the bear look suspicious. The trio end up following a man who they think may be a suspect to the bear shooting. They follow him into the woods and end up running away from a strange sound caused by something big that is chasing them. They team up with the man who they where following, who just happens to be the #1 and only Troll hunter in Norway who explains to them that he doesn't mind them filming what he does, as long as they do exactly what he says. He also explains that the government know about the trolls and that he is paid to hunt them down if they go outside their territories nearer to human populated areas. He also explains that he doesn't care if they film this secret, because the government pays him very little, which I found hard to swallow, but OK.

This is great stuff--it's harkening back to the days when movie monsters were people in rubber monster suits, except the trolls here look a whole lot like plushies, and if you've seen Jonze's movie, you'll instantly recognize the look and feel. vredal takes some jabs at Norse troll folklore (there's one particular scene that's a riff on \"The Three Billy Goats Gruff\" I thought was absolutely hysterical), constructs himself an interesting story, and throws in a twist here and there, thought you'll see most of them coming.Unfortunately, the film does have its problems. Most notably is the pace. This is often a problem with handheld-mockumentary movies, as the guys who supposedly stumble upon the footage and edit it are invariably crap at doing so, or so the filmmakers want us to believe; that's been true ever since &lt;em>The Last Broadcast&lt;/em> (which was the first of them, right?). I will give &lt;em>Trolljegeren&lt;/em> that the subject matter here is a little more interesting than usual, but still, we spend a lot of time talking and not enough time troll-chasing, and perhaps when I was talking about the mash-up back at the beginning I should have thrown in a dash of &lt;em>Twister&lt;/em>.Still, if you're looking for a big, stupid, fun monster movie, there hasn't been much in the recent past that does that combination better than &lt;em>Trolljegeren&lt;/em>.

Now, the trolls would kill and devour other people too but if you were a Christian in this film and were around the trolls you were at a distinct disadvantage.  The main protagonists, who were identified as atheists (or agnostics), were not at quite the same level of danger.  The Christian cameraman is killed and the team hires a Muslim woman to replace him, hoping that the trolls won't be able to smell her.  This didn't really come across necessarily as a slam against Christianity or anything, but a feature of this particular cinematic world that the story was set in.  It made me question why?I could speculate but that's all it would be.  Maybe it was because Christians had a history of persecuting and eliminating the trolls within the history of the movie?  Was it a religious commentary on the clash of pagan or old-world folklorish beliefs violently opposed to new-world Christian and \"western: beliefs?

This film is one of those rare 'docudramas' that bring to light historical 'secrets' that beg to be shared. In 2000 an American water company bought the water supply from the Bolivian government and the citizens of Bolivia were banned from collecting rainwater which had become corporate property. This resulted in a violent protest against the government by the indigenous Indians and the citizenry of Cochambamba, Bolivia who claimed their rights to the natural gifts of nature - even the rain. Laverty and Bolla&iacute;n expose this injustice through a well-conceived story within a story.Spanish film director Sebasti&aacute;n (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), his cynical producer Costa (Luis Tosar), and crew including Ant&oacute;n (Karra Elejalde) have come to Cochabamba, Bolivia to shoot their film about Christopher Columbus (played by actor Ant&oacute;n - Karra Elejalde) and his first explorations, revealing the way the Spaniards treated the native Indians: Costa has chosen the place because he can get cheap labor in using local actors and extras to keep within the small budget of the film. Sebasti&aacute;n is the compassionate one who wants the Indians treated well, hiring a mouthy young Indian named Hatuey/Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) when he claims he and his family are being unjustly overlooked as actor candidates. The filming goes well, with the exception of some minor glitches for particular scenes the Indians find too dangerous, until a conflict develops over the governmental privatization of the water supply. Daniel becomes an activist against the government who plan a 300% increase in price of water - the average daily income for the Indians is $2. a day! - and the conditions in the city become unfriendly for the film to continue. Bloody violence and chaos breakout and many citizens are being killed or jailed. It is at this point that the caring Sebasti&aacute;n finally decides that he and his crew must flee, and with some role reversal, Costa stays behind to protect Daniel's family.According to Bolla&iacute;n, 'It was the gold 500 years ago, and now it's the water, which is the gold of the 21st century. Before it was the Crown of Spain and the pope who approved the conquest. Now it is the new theologians, the IMF and the World Bank. Again it's the word from above, saying, 'This is right.' The Spanish filmmakers in the film-within-a-film are caught in the middle. They have the attitude of neo-conquerors - they go there because it's cheap. But they're also trying to make a film that casts a different look on the conquest. And it's an adventure.'Iciar Bolla&iacute;n directs this epic film with great dignity and with a keen observation of how history, even inadvertently, repeats itself. The cinematography by Alex Catal&aacute;n and the musical score by Alberto Iglesias add immeasurably to the film's success.  The cast of extras is exceptional and very well directed. Both Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal and Luis Tosar deliver intensely considered performances as does Juan Carlos Aduviri as the key central figure Daniel.

They have chosen the area because they are on a limited budget and know they can hire local extras for next to nothing.At auditioning a feisty Indian, Daniel kicks up a fuss about not getting a screen test, Sebastian decides to take him on. They are shooting a film about Columbus set in 1511, and they want to use contemporary accounts as much as possible to keep it accurate. They are also keen to show how the Indians were exploited by the Spanish Empire and show a few good men who stood up for the Indians and the tyranny of the Church.Things go well at first and the historical scenes are absolutely brilliant - would make an excellent film in itself to be honest. But then they discover that Daniel is a leading activist against the privatisation of water or more accurately the theft of water, which is referenced in the title of the film. The local police enforce the foreign privately owned water companies policies and as water means life, it is only inevitable that the Indians will fight back.So as filming rolls on, the five hundred year old events start to have a strange resonance with what is actually taking place in the present, and the parallels with the Conquistadors is only too obvious.This then is a truly brilliant piece of cinema; you almost get two films in one or three if you include the people making a documentary of the making of the film.

Though a non-professional actor, Daniel turns out perfect for the role, but presence of Daniel, who is an activist involved with the protest against the water privatization, could cause trouble when public uprising against the water rates becomes inevitable.Like many of Laverty/Loach collaborations, \"Even the Rain\" has strong social comments, but this time the film has a unique narrative structure juxtaposing events separated in time, that involve the exploiters and the exploited. The film-within-film has a scene of Antonio de Montesinos delivering his sermon, so that no one would miss the point.The film works best as a drama about the main character Costa and his transformation. I find his role as a film producer unconvincing - he risks too much as a film producer - but Luis Tosar delivers a beautifully restrained performance that is so impressive that you almost forget the film's obvious flaws.

I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Three is as intriguing as the previous two seasons though dark clouds hang over the Bellamy household. A terrible tragedy causes much strife and chaos in the Bellamy household. Son James falls in love with a woman not of his social class, and the staff downstairs are also experiencing problems of their own. Finances in the Bellamy household are tight this season and the residents of 165 Eaton Place are forced to economize, both upstairs and downstairs.This third season of the show sees a death in the family, a marriage, a murderer putting the lives of the residents of 165 Eaton in danger, and the possibility of romance! The writing as always is engaging, and the plot lines keep me riveted to the screen!

Skilled copper, multiple crimes, additional plots, romantic moments, and comedy also in the mix. The Glades takes place in Palm Glades, a fictitious small town Florida (somewhere near the Everglades), while Midsomer is rural English villages. Glades storylines take into account Florida history, out-of-the-way settings, habitats, politics, animal life, ethnic diversity, and of courts FL-style murder. Also expect many bathing beauties--it's Florida. Like Midsomer, Glade makes use of MANY guest stars, too numerous to mention. Includes contemporary music worked into the story. Murder solving is by the episode but other relationship plots are ongoing from the beginning pilot in Season 1 through this set of stories.Returning: Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore, an Aussie using American accent recognized only by bonus material in Series 1 DVD) is a top crime solver, but knows it and up-talks everyone from his boss to his partner. Capable of his own quick funny jabs, forensic med. examiner Carlos (Carlos Gomez-a real Cuban/American playing one in a super performance) is an extra smart Dr. while FDLE boss Colleen (Michelle Hurd-who began in the pilot as a barmaid, is stunning as well as in charge). Tough and hot, as quick-witted as Longworth, Callie (Kiele Sanchez) is a nurse with a kid Jeff (Uriah Shelton) and jailbird husband Ray (Clyne Crawford) but he's about to be released for narking aid, and Callie will soon gain new employment. The new employment only adds to the romantic conflict for her and Longworth, sometimes generating spontaneous frivolity. The great regulars must include Daniel (Jordan Wall-FL local actor making it big in this series) intern who's funny, quick, smart, and a good bit of a computer nerd.Episodes for season 2 (SUBTITLED)1 FAMILY MATTERS-2 OLD GHOSTS-3 LOST AND FOUND- `new' forensic nurse introduced4 MOONLIGHTING-5 LITTLE DIRTY SECRETS-6 GIBTOWN- a town of the strange and bizarre7 ADDICTED TO LOVE-8 SECOND SKIN-9 IRON PIPELINE-10 SWAMP THING-Can the success continue to Season 3?

Since its debut in 2007, the show has provided big ratings for the network and its popularity has helped to restructure the entire network's programming slate. You know the drill. For two months a year, big rig hauling over the tundra is necessary to supply remote outposts before the eventual thaw. It's a dangerous profession as we're informed on EACH and EVERY episode. After five years, I think we get it! In truth, everything that you need to know about the job specifics of ice road trucking was covered long ago. The show's success now firmly rests on its cast of characters who can be both likable and somewhat abrasive.The 16 episodes that comprise this 4 disc set bring you the latest antics of Hugh, Alex, Lisa and Rick as well as many others in the profession. If you like the show, obviously this is an easy recommendation. My personal thought is that we've pretty much covered every topic conceivable in the last five seasons and I'm not as enthusiastic about the show as I was several years ago. I'm obviously in the minority, however, as viewership when it aired on History rose 30% between the fourth and fifth seasons.

While the main character's werewolf form is incredibly unscary, the rest of the series is quite strong -- even if it does seem to use lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty.Weedy teenager Scott McCall (Tyler Posey) and his nerdy buddy Stiles (Dylan O'Brien) are prowling through a woods where a murder has recently occurred, and a large furry animal bites Scott. The following day, he finds that he's gained incredible senses, healing and agility -- which allows him to become the new star of the lacrosse team.Stiles claims Scott is a werewolf, but Scott ignores him... until he starts transforming in the middle of a date with a new girl in town, Allison (Crystal Reed). Another werewolf, Derek Hale (Tyler Hoechlin) takes Scott under his wing to educate him about how to control his lycanthropic urges, since anything that raises his heart rate can transform him at a moment's notice.Even worse: there are an ancient family of werewolf hunters in the area, and it turns out that Allison's dad and sadistic aunt are among them. Also, jock Jackson (Colton Haynes) is sniffing out Scott's secret.But Scott's high school woes soon become the least of his troubles. He was turned into a werewolf by an alpha -- a savage, bloodthirsty creature who is killing more people around the town. And somehow this rampage is connected to a fire that killed Derek's entire family several years ago. And if Scott doesn't join the alpha, the lives of everyone he loves will be endangered...\"Teen Wolf\" hits a solid balance of teen romance, dark action, gore, horror and dry comedy. It's hard to get all those elements in the right proportions, but for the most part the series gets it right. The only problem is that a few episodes are a little too heavy on the teen soap opera romance (oh noes! Scott is making out with Jackson's girlfriend whom Stiles is also crushing on! ANGST! DRAMA!).But when the focus is on the werewolf stuff, \"Teen Wolf\" shines -- there's lots of growling, misty woods, and bloody violence, and the writers throw some curveballs at the audience (just who/what IS that vet?!). There's also an atmosphere of growing tension and darkness, which grows stronger as the season unfolds. Fortunately, the writers know how to leaven the story with plenty of humor, usually from Stiles (\"What did I sound like to you?\" \"Like a cat being choked to death\").The special effects are a little dodgy. Some of them (like the alpha werewolf form) are decent, but the CGI werewolf maws are sometimes goofy-looking -- and the beta werewolf form is not scary AT ALL.The cast is pretty uniformly solid -- even seemingly-cliched characters like Lydia (the Queen Bee/Mean Girl), Chris Argent (Allison's scary werewolf-hunter dad) and Jackson (the arrogant jock who desperately wants to be a werewolf) are well-rounded, with excellent reasons for them to act and feel as they do. Posey, Hoechlin and O'Brien make a solid central trio as the earnest good boy, the tall-dark-and-brooding bad boy, and the nerdy sidekick respectively, and they all have excellent chemistry.\"Teen Wolf\" has a few freshman wobbles, but overall it's a sleek, eerie story that balances action, romance and horror in equal measure.

As the network was trying to establish a successful slate of scripted programming, however, a sexy and suspenseful werewolf thriller made sense. I just didn't know if MTV could get the right creative force to put the project together in an interesting way and utilize the budget and effects necessary to make it stand apart from the supernatural crowd. I think it's fair to say that this is more of a complete reinvention of the source film as opposed to any sort of remake. Aside from sharing an overlapping central theme, the two projects couldn't be more dissimilar. But utilizing the same sensibilities that have made \"Vampire Diaries\" a success, this wolf saga is an intoxicating blend of humor, romance, and chills. Starting as more of a frothy comedy, the series gradually incorporated darker elements as the narrative unfolded until you were sometimes surprised just how effective the thriller aspect was working.I used \"Vampire Diaries\" as a specific reference point, because I also think that \"Teen Wolf\" has all the qualities needed to become a break-out hit. It is a show that would certainly be appreciated by people that don't watch MTV. \"Vampire Diaries\" on CW had an uneven (but likable) first season, but turned into a surprisingly sophisticated soap opera for a stellar second season. \"Wolf,\" similarly, has the potential to evolve further into a smart and multi-layered entertainment. The twelve episodes of Season One, by necessity, focused on two major plot points--a boy who becomes a wolf and the search for his maker. In the show, Tyler Posey plays the central character. As he starts to understand what is happening, the scripts deftly blends comedy, confusion, and awe as he gets an unlikely tutor in the form of a more serious wolfman played by Tyler Hoechlin. The early episodes exhibit plenty of charm as Posey relishes his new school status and blossoming romance. As the show progresses, the sense of danger becomes a primary ingredient. I wasn't crazy about every aspect that helped bring the Alpha story line to fruition. The central mystery, when it was finally revealed, lacked a bit of surprise or impact for me. But it was a small point in an otherwise engaging season.While the entire cast is attractive and effective, I've got to throw out props to Posey. Of course, only in TV land would Posey be considered a loser. Adorable smile, killer physique, and all around charming demeanor--the show brands him a geek initially for the apparent reason that he is an asthmatic (inhalers are so unsexy). He juggles the complexities of his role with dexterity and is always a winning protagonist--it is easy to be invested in his plight and emotional journey. As his wacky sidekick, Dylan O'Brien also gets a special shout-out from me. Why? He portrays the biggest cliche' possible as Posey's wise-cracking best friend and still makes it seem effortless and new. I really enjoyed this show. Fast and stylish, with an appropriately impressive MTV soundtrack, this is sheer entertainment. It doesn't have lofty goals--it just wants to give you a fun ride. And that it does.

The costumes, locations, sets and props are superb. It's a very stylish show, with high production value. The music (especially the title track by Flint Eastwood) is killer and the overall production value superb.  The problem with this show? The writing; specifically the portrayal of the CIA (and other intelligence agencies). The show routinely shows CIA agents conducting covert ops inside the U.S., targeting U.S. persons for ops, breaking various laws, acting in irresponsible and illegal ways. Their interaction with other intelligence agencies is always competitive, antagonistic and marked by direct competition. The ignorance (or is it disinformation?) regarding U.S. intelligence agencies (do five minutes of research on Google, why don't you?!) is disturbing, insulting, and distracting. The acting ranges from fair to downright abysmal - If Christopher Gorham is supposed to play a blind person why is he constantly dodging furniture, doorways and objects directly in his path?

Season 5 is in production and will air the summer of 2014.I enjoyed the first two seasons, because they were fairly plausible.  I guess I can be called a \"purist\" because I like it when there is some similitude between the truth and the deeds and actions.  For example, the heroine of the piece gets into a tight spot in a foreign country and then she is back at Langley and there is no explanation how she came so far so quickly.  Also, the military equipment has to be \"right\" i.e. vehicles and weapons should be the ones used by the countries that are portrayed.  Nothing puts me off more than to see Russian soldiers driving American trucks.  Still, that is just \"me\" I guess.  There is action galore and suspense by the bucket!  The story is moving all the time, so from that standpoint, it is very entertaining.  You find yourself having to catch your breath after each of the break-neck pursuits.  Those are the bits that I would give 5 Stars to.  Now, the bad news:  Where it really falls down is the main character herself.  She is undisciplined and has little respect for authority.  She goes her own way, against direct orders and consequently gets her backside in a sling most of the time.  She always has to rely on others to get her out of the scrapes she creates, most of which were totally avoidable.  She gets other people killed unnecessarily because of her being a loose cannon.  And, by the time you get to season three, the predicaments she gets into are infuriating and the escapes become more and more unlikely.  After three seasons, a lot of the tension is gone because you know this Mata Harri is going to get through it all no matter how great the odds or unlikely the success of the rescue plans.  There are at least a half a dozen times in the series when she should have been shot dead without any doubt if this was real life and yet, she gets away!  If this young lady worked for me, I would give her a job in the company canteen, chain her to her position, allowing her to only leave for potty breaks!  I won't be watching season 4 or 5, because I can already guess what is going to happen.  They have to keep re-working the murdery bits and the intrigues between the characters.  To the plus side of the ledger:  The cast is very good and you feel a rapport with the main characters, which is what happens when the actors do a good job.  This series is hugely popular, having its own website and ways of following your favorite characters.  If you are able to overlook the many and obvious short comings and keep telling yourself \"remember, this is only telly\" then you will pass many enjoyable evenings, because each season is 16 episodes.

I am so glad I finally gave it a try. It is my Tip Top Fave among new shows in 2011. My only complaint is that the first season was just too short. If you want details about the show, find the review on Amazon by Grady Harp. That is an excellent and comprehensive review.I'm a dedicated fan of Gina Torres, so I'm lovin' her mastery of this very stylish new role. I'm also very impressed with the other female regulars. These characters are strong, smart, witty, and independent with nary a cliche' among them to cling to; well acted, but also very well written.Mike Ross is adorable, brash yet humble, and somehow seems like everybody's favorite cousin most of the time. He caves in to the vampire prince, Trevor, too easily and that's my one caution on this series. I hope the writers will do everything in their power to avoid falling into the formulaic style that forces them to reuse familiar devices like Trevor to engineer conflict into an episode. A guy like Trevor would keep coming back, but a guy like Mike with a break like this job would kick the ratfink to the curb or call in special forces before he'd belly up again with that punk.Haven't had so much fun with a show since Castle came out and I haven't enjoyed dialogue & story so much since Aaron Sorkin left West Wing. Leverage I also like, but it's the difference between cotton candy and a Red Velvet Cupcake.The comparison to The Good Wife is not useful in my opinion. Good Wife uses the law firm as a backdrop for the character dramas, but the story is driven by sexual encounters. Suits uses the business of law as the catalyst and the stories are more about how the actual work develops character.And Gabriel Macht! Dear Lord, what a classy character. Everytime I want to label him as a Mako, he surprises me with a big teddy bear move. There is a terrible tension that one must wrestle in a powerful position like Harvey's.

The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately.SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact.The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclich&eacute;d, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit!

Far as I'm concerned, SUITS is the newest addictive show on television, and that's me not normally drawn to legal dramas. It's witty and funny and smart and loaded with that patented easy-breezy sense of fun that the USA network nowadays specializes in. The premise is irresistible, the cast is irrepressible. The two leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams, are so very good. I can't not rave.SUITS chronicles the exploits of the prestigious New York corporate law firm Pearson Hardman. More pointedly, the catchy premise revolves around sleek newly-made senior partner Harvey Specter (Macht) who dips into shady shenanigans when he takes under his wing a college dropout who was running away from the law when he happened to stumble across Harvey's office just when Harvey was in the middle of interviewing first year associates. Turns out, there's more to Mike Ross (Adams) than just being a slacker and a weed merchant. Mike boasts an eidetic memory. He reads something, he understands it. Once he understands it, he never forgets it. It's a neat party trick. It intrigues Harvey enough, impresses him enough, that he decides to gamble on Mike. And since Pearson Hardman only ever hires from a pool of Harvard law graduates, then begins the big fib of Mike Ross, Harvey's new associate and recent Harvard alumni.Mike Ross is a resourceful, idealistic cat (that whole weed thing was a one-time mistake). He makes for a terrific point-of-view character. As he navigates his way around his new environment, as he learns, we learn. Will Mike sink or swim in these shark-infested waters? That's part of the fun. In just about each episode, Mike is thrown a curve, is put in a situation in which he could get exposed. Sometimes, his quick thinking and his immaculate sense of recall get him out of predicament. Sometimes, Harvey, cool as the other side of the pillow, steps in. How long can these two keep up the charade? The show dares you to step away.Macht, gleam all wicked in his eye and so much hair gel the headrest of his Barcalounger is afraid, embodies Harvey Specter with supreme swagger, cocky and ruthless and unruffled. Once in a blue moon he exhibits his (begrudgingly) compassionate side. Harvey is touted as the firm's go-to closer, its most heralded gunslinger. In his competitive field, it's no surprise that his colleagues are resentful. And maybe none more envious than the always scheming junior partner Louis Litt (that fabulous gopher Rick Hoffman). Hoffman is great as the perennial burr in the saddle. He quickly makes Mike's time in the firm a partly sucky one. Mike becomes the human rope in Harvey and Louis' ongoing game of tug-of-war.Q: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer?A: His partners.Let me fragment sentence you: Predatory boardroom sharks, cooly preening and posturing and bedeviling clients with silver tongues, and yet graced with just enough of that bump of conscience to humanize them. I found myself suckered into that simmer between Mike and sexy, five-year paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle). I relish the hell out of Sarah Rafferty who plays Harvey's sassy secretary Donna, and we note Donna's understated pining for her boss. In fact, the interactions among the cast members are absorbing all around. Gina Torres as the firm's steely managing (and founding) partner is the icing on the cake. The cases handled by Harvey and Mike are watchable enough, and the legalese thrown at us is made decipherable enough. For those trying to become better people, morals and ethics are explored intelligently. Each time I side with Mike's naive nice guy perspective, Harvey extends a counter-argument which sheds a new light on the matter. My favorite moments are those in which Harvey sarcastically mentors Mike (with Mike frequently giving as good as he gets) and those moments in which Mike scrambles to maintain his Harvard cover. And I don't mind at all any scene in which the weasely Louis Litt gets what's coming to him. And let me reiterate: SUITS is FUNNY. I'm already 5 episodes deep into Season 2, and, if anything, I've gotten even more hooked. In Season 2, the stakes have shot up even more. As for Season One, get it. Get it now.The SUITS DVD set contains all twelve episodes of Season One and comes in three discs and with the following bonus stuff:- Pilot Extended Version- Audio Commentaries on 2 episodes: the pilot episode and the season finale \"Dogfight\" (both eps with exec. producer David Bartis, creator/co-exec. producer Aaron Korsh, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams)- Deleted Scenes for 7 episodes- Gag Reel (00:04:13 minutes)- \"Cross Examination\": Gabriel Macht, Meghan Markle, Patrick J.

In both there is little courtroom drama. But the fact that they are similar isn't the whole story.Suits is better directed, has better sets, and the writing is superior in my opinion. I also like the actors and characters in Suits more than The Good Wife. I had to watch the whole first season of Suits, and half of season 2 before I was drawn fully into it. The smart and surprising thing is many of the loose ends from the first season are opened wide in the second season.I much prefer the courtroom drama over the focus and struggle of the law firm, but Suits does it well enough to hold my interest. The brash character Harvey Specter begins to show he is human in the second season. The smart Mike Ross expands his shift to honesty while crossing the line from time to time.I find Suits to be a compelling series and I look forward to more episodes. I just wish the constant bickering and pyramid building would be tempered in both Suits and The Good Life. Alas I believe that is the main focus of both series so I don't expect it to go away.

Mike has an eidetic memory so he is really useful in remembering small bits of information and he manages to save the day a lot. Harvey has a lot of confidence in his abilities and at times can come across as arrogant, but he really steals the show when he is onscreen. He exudes this amazing amount of charm and utter coolness.

Yet, you always hope a show can tweak the formula and give you something you haven't seen a hundred times previously. While USA Network's \"Suits\" certainly isn't revolutionary television in its casework, it has brought something quite unexpected to the defense table.  Spending more time in the boardroom than in the courthouse, this remarkably engaging show has brought a sense of smarts and sophistication to the proceedings--and trust me, I haven't used the word sophistication to describe a basic cable TV show in some time.  A lot of elements work just fine here, but there are two specific things that elevate this show to the next level.  First, the dialogue is snappy, genuinely funny and filled with clever wordplay.  Second, the two leads (Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams) have uncommonly good timing in serving up that dialogue.  Furthermore, their relationship (a blossoming bromance, if you will, of give and take) is electric--a true standout in the television landscape.The show, like any other, needs a hook to set up its premise.  The conceit here is that Adams is a legal prodigy.  Unfortunate life choices have derailed his chosen career path and he exists as a typical mid-twenties slacker.  When his life starts unraveling, he has a fortuitous meeting with Macht, a successful and brilliant attorney.  Macht, a huge egoist, is looking for \"the next me\" to be his assistant.  Adams, of course, fits the bill--just one problem.  Despite his vast and encyclopedic knowledge, he's not really a lawyer.  But this being television, this is a slight complication which requires some creative navigation.  Is it strictly believable?  Not particularly.  But it is handled in such a fashion that you want to stick with it.  Again, credit must be given to the verbal sparring between the two men.The cases themselves, from episode to episode, don't always break new ground.  The show, however, is reliably good fun with a nice bite.  I like the supporting cast as well.  Gina Torres, as head of the firm, has some nice moments as a sexy and strong professional.  Rick Hoffman plays a largely comedic rival and foil to Macht--and while I like him, it's not always a consistent characterization.  Meghan Markle is a suitably appealing paralegal that challenges Adams to be a better man.  And the show's silent secret weapon is Macht's receptionist Sarah Rafferty, who with just a few minutes of screen time every episode makes me laugh out loud!  But still the show would not exist without the easy charm of Macht and Adams, who play off one another to perfection.  When they aren't together, you notice the absence.  Add the truly witty banter with the undercurrent of rivalry and respect, and this pairing is the best duo to hit TV in a long time!

I think the actor who plays Harvey Spector, Gabriel Macht, does a great job of portraying a high functioning, successful psychopath. People get the wrong idea about the character traits of psychopathy: fearlessness, the ability to shut down emotion, to be ruthless in pursuit of a goal, these are not necessarily bad things in context. If you need a great trial attorney on your side, a guy like Harvey is your man, hands down.  Even his decision to hire a guy who has no law degree, no bar membership and is running from the law as his associate is a very psychopathic trait. Psychopaths don't care about breaking rules, laws, mores when it suits them. It's important to remember that psychopathy, like every other personality trait lies along a sliding scale from high functioning to totally screwed up.But I do have a problem with the basic premise that somehow the pretend attorney can get away with it in the high power world of New York Corporate law. (Not to say it hasn't been done by real people - it has - but not forever. Sooner or later everyone gets caught.) The very fact that EVERY lawyer who works in this firm goes to Harvard Law makes it even more improbable. The law is a set of small worlds that revolve around the court system like planets around the sun. Lawyers who graduated from Harvard Law would be the planet Mercury. Lawyers who went to Harvard Law and worked in New York City would be a moon orbiting Mercury (if Mercury had a moon). You can see the issue here. Even more improbable is the idea that the Managing Partner of the firm would put up with it for a single moment after she discovered the truth.If, and it's a very BIG if, you can suspend your disbelief, then this show can be a lot of fun. And again I have to give kudos to Gabriel Macht for such a fine portrayal of a high functioning, successful psychopath. This is what these men and women look like in the corporate world.Patrick J. Adams also gives a great performance as the guy who slides along on the strength of his brain thinking that he can make it through life without paying the bill.Gina Torres as Jessica, the managing partner - great performances.Like I said, the cast is great, the storyline is fun -- it's just hard to keep believing.", "term": "While the Acting is Great and its a Fun Series - The Premise is hard for Me to Swallow", "id": "9616:1_0"}, "9617:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "entertaining and interesting legal show. good acting, characters aredeveloped well. too bad after the 1st season it is not free with prime.", "term": "great show", "id": "9617:1_0"}, "9618:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I love the fact that is so smart doesn't have to have a degree to do a job and save lives", "term": "Totally great", "id": "9618:1_0"}, "9619:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This series is interesting, can be funny at times.

You know, less spandex and magical powers, more \"regular\" people.The latest example is \"Alphas,\" a TV series that focuses on otherwise ordinary people with strange evolutionary quirks like supersenses, influencing minds and \"seeing\" electronic signals. It's one of those series that is solid and fun, but it feels like it hasn't fully grown into itself just yet -- but the last episode does imply that big things are coming.The CIA is stumped when a key witness is shot... in an empty room with no windows. The case is handed over to Dr. Rosen (David Strathairn), a scientist who has a special team of \"Alphas\" -- and they soon determine that the shooter is also an Alpha, Cameron Hicks (Warren Christie), who is being controlled by someone else.Among the problems the team encounters are: a kid with rage pheromones, a bunch of mystery deaths at a high school, a kidnapped heiress who can only be found with Gary's abilities, a woman who can MacGuyver almost any device from scraps, a cult leader who is slowly destroying his followers, a shape-shifter, and an invisible menace who is stalking a prisoner.But the biggest problem comes not from Alphas, but from regular humans. A terrorist cell known as Red Flag reveals that our dear government is trying to surreptitiously stamp out or imprison all Alphas, and the tenuous relationship between Dr. Rosen's group and the government becomes more fragile with time. If they can't stop it, war will be the next step.\"Alphas Season 1\" follows the basic X-Men formula -- an idealistic father-figure/mentor who oversees the young superpowered people, in a world that fears and hates them blah blah blah. It doesn't stray too far from that formula, but it does seem to be trying to have more \"realistic\" abilities (flight or fight, for example) instead of assigning magical superpowers.Most of the first season is made up of standalone episodes -- each one has a solid mix of comedy (Gary trying to divide his burrito), acrobatic action scenes, and some intriguing moral questions about terrorism and interference in evolution. But the series doesn't REALLY take off until the last episode of the season, which is not only intense and heartbreaking, but it radically changes the way the Alphas live in this world. That episode is what boots this season from \"okay\" to \"good.\"It has a pretty solid cast too -- David Strathairn does a particular good job as a kindly man who genuinely wants normal humans and Alphas to live in peace, but whose idealism is slowly dwindling. Azita Ghanizada is great as a girl who is incapable of having a normal life because of her abilities, and is hurt by her family's view of her. Laura Mennell, Christie and Malik Yoba are pretty good as well.And Ryan Cartwright is EXCELLENT as high-functioning autistic kid Gary. Not only does he do an excellent job depiction autism, but he shows us Gary's determination to make his own choices and have his own friends (including a Red Flag girl).\"Alphas Season 1\" is merely good most of the time, but it really, really blossoms when it focuses on Red Flag and the impending Alpha/human war.

It's about a group of humans with superpowers who fight criminals, but with an attempt to make the superheroes more realistic rather than like comic book characters.The show is entertaining. It never really rises to greatness though. Three things held it back. First, it seems too familiar, almost like a &#34;Heroes Lite.&#34; There's nothing that really makes the show stick out, except perhaps David Strathairn, who defies the stereotypes as an elderly, kindly leader who lacks superpowers.Second, the show never seemed like it was going anywhere. Like a modern serials, which seem obsessed with continuity, the show keeps dropping hints about a bigger mystery but seldom provides resolution. Some villains disappear from the picture without use even knowing who they were or why they were such a threat. We do get some character development, especially with the female characters, but the male characters seem stuck in place. Some characters seem to just pop up once or twice but don't seem to really drive anything further.Finally, the ensemble doesn't fully work. There are a lot of things I like about the characters. They seem much more real and grounded than most TV sci-fi characters. Also, I'm glad they didn't choose a bunch of supermodels for all of the roles (the actors are attractive but not supermodels). Individually, the characters work pretty well.Unfortunately, collectively it seems like there are cliques, as if they don't all work as a team.

I didn't have that same level of excitement when watching the first few episodes of ALPHAS, and maybe it's partly a case of fool me once... ALPHAS doesn't present as intriguing or sweeping a mythology as HEROES, or as sprawling a cast. It lacked that sense of grandeur. Still, ALPHAS makes for decent viewing for comic book fans like me. After the dismal showings of NO ORDINARY FAMILY and THE CAPE, I'm just glad the networks are still throwing superhero televison a bone.If you're down with the X-MEN comics, then nothing in ALPHAS will throw you for a loop. There's a creaky familiarity to ALPHAS, with X-MEN having done it first and better. Instead of \"muties,\" the mistrusted super-powered contingent in this world are labeled \"alphas.\" In Season One, our point-of-view character is Cameron Hicks (generic handsome hunk Warren Christie), a grocery clerk who'd served time in the military. Hicks boasts unerring marksmanship coupled with unnatural grace and athleticism, except that Hicks tends to buckle under pressure and so is unable to consistently perform up to his potential. Still, when he becomes a suspect in an implausible fatal shooting, it doesn't take too long before he's recruited by the government-sanctioned team of alphas dedicated to solving alpha-related crimes.Part of my \"meh\" attitude springs from the overall blandness of the characters, even though they do exhibit an array of interesting abilities. There's an FBI guy (Malik Yoba) who can, at will, trigger his endocrinal \"fight or flight\" response, endowing him with temporary strength and durability, except that his channeling of this talent has a detrimental affect on his health. Britisher Ryan Cartwright, who last we saw had a dramatic death scene in BONES, plays an autistic young technopath, meaning he can manipulate the electromagnetic field, enabling him to access even the most restricted of computer databases. There's a morally-challenged \"pusher\" (Laura Mennell) who bends people to her will once eye contact is made. To me, the most interesting role falls to Azita Ghanizada. She plays a fragile woman who can heighten any of her senses, although when she uses her ability, she tunes everything else out, rendering her easy to sneak up on. Not surprisingly, she's an exceptional crime scene investigator. David Strathairn has the thankless Professor X role, the on-the-surface wise and benevolent head of the alphas task force. But, as episodes unfold, we learn that Strathairn's character harbors sneaky shades of gray. I do like that all these characters present feet of clay. They all exhibit some type of flaw, and that helps to sustain interest. I only wish they were even more interesting. Strathairn's role is borderline unlikable. Warren Christie as the prohibitive male lead is vanilla.Because I like superhero stories in general, I did have fun watching Season One. But it's no breath of fresh air, no game changer. I watch it on Cable On Demand, don't value it highly enough to DVR it. You see where the narrative is heading. The overarcing conflict plays out in familiar ways. The episodes give you just enough steak but not enough sizzle. I did like the moral ambiguity exhibited with regards to the protagonists' choices and actions. Our alphas gradually come to suspect that they may be acting in concert with the wrong side, what with the government seemingly harboring a nasty agenda concerning detained alphas. And, really, what's a thriller show without an ongoing conspiracy? I perked up a lot when the fifth episode, \"Never Let Me Go,\" swung around and featured Dr. Vanessa Calder (Lindsay Wagner). Dr. Calder's appearance plants ALPHAS squarely in the same universe as EUREKA and WAREHOUSE 13. With EUREKA now canceled, there better be a spate of ALPHAS/WAREHOUSE 13 crossovers. 3 out of 5 stars for ALPHAS Season One. Thankfully, in Season 2, the storytelling is even stronger. The characters may yet grow on me.

He's co-written or co-plotted some of the most embarrassing failures of the Superhero genre to date, such as ELEKTRA, and X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. He also wrote original drafts of both the first and second HULK films and what is widely considered the greatest superhero film of all time, THE AVENGERS. However the success of the second HULK film was largely due to star Edward Norton almost completely rewriting the script (under the name Edward Harrison, but was denied any credit by the Writer's Guild), and the gargantuan success of THE AVENGERS, script-wise, is credited wholly to the brilliant Joss Whedon (and rightfully so, since Penn was actually relegated to a co-plotter). So from this resume', one might assume that while Penn may be a fan of the Superhero genre, he's certainly no expert at it.With his series ALPHAS, co-created with Michael Karnow, Penn has proved that not only can he craft a really clever \"superhero\" story, but a very tightly-constructed television show that's both action-packed and whip-smart.From the outset of the show, we're treated to a number of superhero archetypes: First is Bill Harken (Malik Yoba, the mini-series THIEF, NIKITA) as a gruff former federal agent who has the ability to throw his mental \"fight-or-flight\" response into overdrive and gain temporary super-strength. Next up is Nina Theroux (Laura Mennell, SUPERNATURAL, FRINGE, SMALLVILLE) as a beautiful young woman who can slightly exert her will on other people mentally. Then we have Rachel Pirzad (Azita Ghanizada, bit parts on shows like CASTLE, BONES, PSYCH, etc.), a very pretty girl from a Middle Eastern family who can enhance her five senses. Then comes Gary Bell (the incredible Ryan Cartwright, BONES and MAD MEN), a young man who can actually see wireless communication and decode it. Next is Cameron Hicks (Warren Christie, APOLLO 18, STEVEN SEAGAL'S TRUE JUSTICE), a handsome and rugged former Marine who has not only uncanny aim with anything he can get his hands on, but also can slightly predict where to move to allow uninterrupted motion. Finally, there's their leader, Dr. Lee Rosen (the always-amazing David Strathairn, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, SNEAKERS, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK), a psychiatrist who has assembled this merry band of abnormally-powered beings he refers to as \"Alphas\" to work for the government to take down threats perpetrated by other Alphas.But the archetypes are somehow broken or twisted so that they actually work to create more fleshed-out characters. Harken's abilities not only affect his mental state, but can put a dangerous amount of stress on his heart. Theroux used to be habitual about using her powers dangerously, using them solely for \"borrowing\" cars and homes and also inadvertantly caused her boyfriend's suicide. Rachel's sense abilities are intense and exact but she can only use one sense at a time at the cost of all of her other senses. Gary is a high-functioning autistic. Cameron has perhaps the most immediate problem since the pilot episode is the team actually chasing him after he had been mind-controlled into an assassination and could go to prison for the rest of his life if anyone but the team found out. Dr. Rosen is not an Alpha, and despite his intelligence and perceptive abilities, is also perhaps not the ideal leader for a group of covert super-powered government agents.The Big Bad, as it were, is a terrorist/freedom-fighter organization called Red Flag, which is essentially Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants to Professor Xavier's X-Men. Their mission statement is similar as well; Red Flag believes that being an Alpha is the next evolutionary step. Dr. Rosen believes in protecting the existing Alphas but also protecting the world from those Alphas that are on the extremist side. It all sounds kind of familiar, I know. But what is unusual for a show of this type is how this show allows for the characters and the interaction to evolve, grow and learn about themselves and the ways that their abilities can be used differently as well as how they can be an impediment to really living their lives.The cast is quite good with the standouts really being Strathairn, Ghanizada, and Cartwright. Guest stars come from all over the genre television world, from Lindsay Wagner (who reprises her role as Dr. Calder from another SyFy show, WAREHOUSE 13, basically placing this show in the same universe of existence as that show and apparently also EUREKA) to Callum Keith Rennie (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the last X-FILES film) to Summer Glau (FIREFLY/SERENITY, DOLLHOUSE) to Brent Spiner STAR TREK: TNG) to Garret Dillahunt (THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES) to Rebecca Mader (LOST). The only real weak link in the show to me, cast-wise, is not only the character of Cameron but the actor Warren Christie. Both the character and the actor are a little too stiff and there isn't much to work with in any real mythology to his character other than his apparent past as a wannabe professional baseball pitcher and his desire to provide for his son.The episodes are all compelling, even if sometimes the premise is a little cliched. As a for instance, the episode \"A Short Time in Paradise\" is not a particularly great episode up until the end, since it deals with a Jonestown-esque cult and a religious extremest Alpha who runs it. Also not very strong in most parts is \"Anger Management\", which features a rage-inducing Alpha. By far the best episodes are the ones that revolve primarily around Gary. Ryan Cartwright shows remarkable ability to play a type of role that requires a great deal of care as to not careen off into the gorge of offensive comic stereotype even when the moments he has are genuinely funny. He's not just a character of comic relief. Cartwright plays Gary with weight and depth, even if he's still cut off from a great deal of the world emotionally. It's a very interesting idea from a character perspective to put a character like Gary amongst a group of people who already see the world differently than everyone else, and that creates an even bigger dilemma for the people around him and who care about him since he already is forced to see the world differently from most others.The very best episode of the season is titled \"Rosetta\" in which Gary meets another, more seriously handicapped girl seemingly incapable of any kind of communication, but he connects with and is actually able to understand how she communicates. The episode is actually quite shocking when certain truths are revealed but you still are so in tune with Gary as a character that you understand the desires he has regardless of the episode's big reveal.This is probably the only show since HEROES that has actually taken the idea of superhumans seriously, but has a less spectacular kind of superhuman. Nobody flies, nobody's indestructible, nobody can travel through time or walk through walls. There's always a more realistic explanation to the abilities of each Alpha's powers that gives the series an even greater plausibility, but never detracts from the entertainment of the fantastical elements this show has to offer.If SyFy invested more time and patience in new shows rather than either trying to put together more \"reality\" television or its truly awful original film division, there might be more shows like ALPHAS on that station. The season, coming in at only eleven episodes rather than a more standard thirteen, is a little abbreviated but ends on an extremely climactic moment that could change everything going forward, and fortunately, this show was picked up for a second season, so hopefully, in 2012, we'll see more of Dr. Rosen and his Alphas soon, because this show is too good to just have one season.You may change my mind yet, Zak.", "term": "The Best show of its kind since the first season of HEROES.", "id": "9743:1_0"}, "9744:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Excellent if you enjoy sci-fi in series form without the annoying 16 minutes of advertising each one hour segment.

Someone once said \"life is all about timing\".What this show does well is to go behind scenes into the life of unbalanced players and their collective sense of entitlement.The show is not overly thought provoking, nor is it an adrenaline rush.

For a more serious contemplation of the topic, I might suggest HBO's sublime \"In Therapy.\" Instead, this USA Channel original series aims for the same type of escapism as many of the networks other offerings with its closest cousin being \"Royal Pains.\" The premise, admittedly, is a bit thin. If, however, you can get past this initial contrivance--there is a deft and appealing cast at work here that really sells the show despite any intellectual reservations you may have. Front and center is the immensely likable Callie Thorne (who garnered a Golden Globe nod). Having watched Thorne in numerous guest spots as well as supporting turns in \"The Wire\" and \"Rescue Me,\" it seemed inevitable that someone would have the good sense to cast her in a lead role. Much of the show's success rests squarely on her shoulders and she capably handles both the dramatic and comedic aspects that define the program.Thorne plays a newly single mother who must contend with a difficult separation and typically precocious TV teens. Through the magic of Hollywood fantasy, she lands a cushy gig as the team psychologist for the local pro football team. In addition to this prime assignment, most of which revolves around a spoiled star (an infectiously entertaining Mehcad Brooks), she also consults on other sport related cases (a golfer, a boxer, a poker player, skateboarder, race driver, etc.). Of course, this being TV--a difficult case can usually be cleared up in one episode, there's nothing too deep or particularly believable here! And yet the show wisely develops a number of other characters to downplay the expected case of the week formula. She has a tentative romance with one coach played by Marc Blucas and a far more interesting relationship with the team's security figure (Scott Cohen). These relationships are really the backbone of the show.Thorne is great to watch, she's cute with Blucas. But it's Mehcad Brooks who steals every scene he's in. Playing a complete stereotype, he still brings enough energy and enthusiasm to the performance that it becomes far more original than it initially seems. The deadpan Cohen is also fascinating as the show's most complex character. He has real chemistry with Thorne and their antagonism appears to be moving toward increased intimacy. I'm not in love with every aspect of the show, though. Storylines involving Thorne's kids tend to be especially painful, predictable, and even borderline moronic (one example: someone buys her son a car to replace one that he's totaled. As the car was surely titled in her name, it seems a pretty lame brained plot thread that she wouldn't be alerted as she would hold the title and insurance). And the cases tend to be quite expected, but some are more interesting than others.But as I stated, this isn't about realism but about escapism and fantasy with only a hint of the actual world. But I liked Thorne, Blucas, Brooks and especially Cohen enough to stick around for the twelve episodes of Season One. It's comfortable and pleasant, but it is sold by the great cast. If you like these types of shows (and you know who you are), check it out. But don't be fooled. This isn't a serious study driven by sports or by therapy, but more of a lightweight character drama.

There is an abundance of Australian eye candy, both the human and natural kind; and, at less than 30 minutes each, the episodes move quickly and have an overall pleasant and relaxing feel about them.One mermaid works in Sea World where she interacts with a trained dolphin; one manages a non-alcoholic bar from time to time where she is also involved from time to time with the owner; one is a singer in said bar where she performs with a small band.  Throw in one hunky diver and his scheming sister, a mysterious cave which is associated in some way with the Moon, and you have an interesting storyline.

A catchy opening theme song and its end credits counterpart also adds to the warm feeling that this show imparts.A solid G rating allows a broad audience. One negative is the constant obnoxious behavior of the younger teenage sister of the mermaid Cleo.  She is overbearing to an extreme and never called on it or properly chastised for her deliberate nastiness and mischievous activity.  In fact, her reason for even being a character in this show appears to be non-existent and one wonders why this part was ever created in the first place.  The actress playing her is also unappealing, especially when compared to everyone around her. Perhaps her presence is designed to counterbalance what the producers may have thought was too much saccharin from the others (which I absolutely did not find).  On the contrary, the behavior of the mermaids comes off as being quite &#34;normal&#34;.

Stewart, DVD Verdict --Riley's Fire in Babylon profiles the West Indies Cricket Team, which controlled the sport from 1980 to 1995. The story starts with the \"Calypso Cricketers,\" actually seen singing in some vintage footage from 1975; that team was dismissed by the world of cricket, as it rarely ended a match with anything to sing about. The turning point came with a drubbing--both on the field and with hostile fans--at an Australian test match that year. The team learned its lesson from their often-violent Australian rivals and got tough. A year later, their \"head-on onslaught\" put the team from India--and everyone else--on notice.Fire in Babylon features lots of video from the team's rise to cricket power, often with the original sports announcing. It also provides quotes from the players and team captains who fueled the West Indies victories. However, this isn't a sports documentary--not exactly, at least. What Riley sets out to do isn't to show a team working hard to become champions. Instead, he wants to show what happens when they do.The nations of the West Indies had only recently achieved independence, often with violent clashes. They were also islands, with little common ground. \"Could we beat our former masters at the game they created?\" one player asks; the answer was yes, demonstrated in a 1985 test match against England. The rise of the cricket team brought unity to the region and encouraged the islands' emerging culture, a message hit home by Bunny Wailer of Bob Marley and the Wailers, who offers frequent commentary. Eventually, the team was a symbol of black power in Africa as well.The picture quality is highly variable; some of those old cricket videos are full of scratches and spots. Riley helps things along with stylish graphics, but it's still noticeable. The soundtrack features lots of reggae, including a band performing a cricket song.A brief interview with Riley and producer John Battsek is added as an extra. It's not bad, but I'd have liked a text timeline, both for the team and for the West Indies, and some background on the team's stars and where they are now.Sports documentaries often promise to show viewers that \"it's more than a game.\" Fire in Babylon actually does just that.", "term": "It's more than a game", "id": "9868:1_0"}, "9869:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Those with any sort of interest in cricket should be enthusiastic about the release of \"Fire in Babylon.\"  This intense and eye-opening documentary from Stevan Riley tracks the evolution of the West Indian cricket team from its inception to its inevitable place as International champions.  Their struggles and successes happened in a worldwide arena of racism, political maneuvering, and apartheid.  Far from being a traditional underdog story (and at heart, that's what it is), this is an illuminating look at how the sport developed and the historical context in which this small group of players challenged the status quo.  The team's success is mirrored in how this small chain of islands asserted a newfound national pride and identity after years of colonial rule.  By taking the English gentleman's sport and appropriating it as a field of battle, it changed cricket forever (for good and for bad).Riley has assembled all of the prominent names that you might expect to look back on a certain era (most of the footage deals with the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties).  It documents that the early team notoriety was as entertainers with no particular talent for the sport and notes that the turning point was when they were decimated by the fast bowl pitches of the Australians.  Employing many of the same techniques, the West Indians created a better and more formidable team with four of these notorious fast bowlers.  As their reputation grew (both for talent and brutality), they ascended to the heights of cricket.  The film shows how the team fought the oppression of its own council to break free of its restrictions, divided over issues of apartheid when certain players were coerced into playing in South Africa, faced casual racism around the world, and challenged their former rulers to attain a grudging respect.  You see plenty of cricket, for sure, but a healthy interest in world events will further enhance the experience of viewing \"Fire in Babylon.\"Riley's film is filtered through the perspective of the West Indian team.  Some may see this as a criticism, but it is their viewpoint and interviews that make up the bulk of the film.  For example, as the sport became progressively more dangerous, rules were formalized to protect batters from intentional injury.  And many players were being seriously injured (some with career ending hits).  While some might see this as a necessary response (myself included), the West Indians perceived it as a casual attack on them personally to destroy their team.  It's easy to see their point of view as these rulings affected them greatly, but things have a broader context than are expressed in this film.  Still, \"Fire in Babylon\" raises a lot of great issues and highlights a lot of great players.  In many ways, as I mentioned, it is an underdog story with tremendous appeal.  And not just a sports film, the story shows how our heroes can also stand as significant political and sociological role models in troubled times.  Strong stuff.

You've got cricket, you've got human rights, you've got Bunny Wailer, what more could you possibly ask for?The film's focus, obviously, is on the West Indies cricket team that was eventually dubbed the \"rebels\" (not to be confused with the \"rebel tours\" of the eighties, though those are touched on towards the end of the film), captained by Clive Lloyd but truly headed by Vivian Richards, who would go on to captain the Windies for most of the eighties (and who was recently voted the third-best test batsman in history). The film first discusses the early years of putting together what would eventually become the team that defeated England for an entire decade, focusing on their first few disastrous trips to Australia in the mid-seventies, focusing on the kill-or-be-killed tactics of the infamous Lillee and Thomson, whose \"injure the batsman at all costs\" style would be copied by a few of the West Indian cricketers later in the decade (and which has since been outlawed). After that, it focuses on the tours of England and what they meant in terms of the human rights aspect--\"you brought this game to us, oppressors, and now we're better than you at playing it.\" They were indeed for quite a while.It's an obvious must-view for cricket fans, and I think that sports fans of any stripe will identify with the national-obsession angle  (\"when you got out of school...you bowled until the light faded\").

A lot of the great stand-up comics are no longer with us, but Louis C.K. is not just one of the best alive; he's one of the best period. In 2010, FX gave Louis his own TV show and complete creative control over it. The show, a fictionalized version of his day-to-day life, was titled Louie and it's now one of television's most acclaimed shows. As a huge fan of his stand-up, I was a bit disappointed with the first season. I found it lacking something I couldn't quite put my finger on. I enjoyed the format immediately; the story interwoven with stand-up material. However, those first 13 episodes left something to be desired. Season 2 is an entirely different beast and ultimately a much better show; darker, more emotional, funnier, and each episode seems more thoroughly thought-out. Louis C.K. has found a consistency and rhythm as an actor, director, writer, producer, and editor and he seems more confident with the tone and direction of his show. This season is also much more story-focused, even with one episode centering almost entirely on masturbation.Watching the first season, I immediately noticed that Louie shares similarities with early Woody Allen films. It's a lazy comparison in many ways; both are comedians based in New York. Their humor is quite different, but there's a strong similarity in tone. The music, the New York setting, the dealings with human nature, etc. Allen's humor and dialogue is different from Louis', but the most substantial difference is simply that Allen's comedy is more refined and sophisticated. Watching this season I couldn't escape what a great idea it would be for Allen and C.K. to work together. Imagine my excitement at the recent announcement that he had joined the cast of Allen's upcoming film.Moving right along, Louie starts strong in the first scene of the first episode. Like the first season, the show is not preoccupied with a linear narrative thread. It has a loose structure that disregards continuity in favor of self-contained vignettes that stand on their own merit and can be admired individually. With each new episode you can see Louis' growth as a director and his evolving depth as a storyteller. There are poignant meditations on life and death, as well as some quietly hilarious and subtle moments such as an inspired scene with Louie in a subway watching a man beautifully play his violin as a homeless man disrobes behind him and begins showering himself with a water bottle. Several episodes portray Louie's fruitless pursuit of Pamela (played by actress Pamela Adlon) and the two share some nice chemistry. In one scene, Louie professes his love for her in an extended monologue that ranks as one of the most poignant moments of the entire series. His dealings with Pam are generally the most emotionally resonant passages of the show. There's an extended episode entitled Duckling that follows Louie on a USO tour and it may be the most accomplished episode in his repertoire.Two episodes that really stand out amongst the others are Oh Louie/Tickets and Eddie. The former begins with a rant against the poor quality of modern television, culminating in a face-off with Dane Cook (who plays himself). Many are familiar with the accusations that Cook lifted some of Louis' early material and the episode has the two engaging in a civil, well-written argument about this. The latter episode guest stars comedian Doug Stanhope and its cool seeing two of my favorite comics share the screen together. While Dane Cook essentially plays himself in his episode, Stanhope plays a broken-down comic named Eddie. Obviously, Stanhope and Eddie share similarities in their lifestyle and outlook but Stanhope brings an unexpected amount of pathos and depth to his role that is genuinely Emmy-worthy. Stanhope and C.K. have a strong dynamic together and it seems like there is a genuine friendship there. The entire episode is a triumph.There are many other celebrity guest appearances. One episode features a humble and self-aware Joan Rivers, with a majority of the episode consisting of dialogue between Rivers and C.K. We actually see Louis discovering his strengths as a writer, as this extended dialogue between the two is mesmerizing. Other guest appearances include Steven Wright, Chris Rock, and F. Murray (all appearing in the finale).Not every episode is perfect. While the first episode has a wonderful opening and is well-written and uplifting even, there's a long build-up to a joke that ends with flatulence. This joke is both lazy and unfunny, betraying the quality of what came before it. In the episode Country Drive, Louie takes his children to see their elderly Aunt Ellen. Much of the episode is filler (specifically in the driving scenes), but it contains a strong message and a particularly strong stand-up bit about the differences between Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.This brings me to the stand-up material. The stand-up bits rarely disappoint and there is some very strong material here. I respect Louis for not using sub-par material in favor of making sure all of his strong material makes it into a stand-up special. There are some gems here, one of my favorite bits being his description of a sexual encounter in the show's second episode. As a comedian, Louis C.K. has this brilliant ability to get right to the heart of a topic with such simplicity. This especially works in his favor in the television format. He recently released much of the material here as an audio special entitled WORD: Live at Carnegie Hall through his website, but even my familiarity with it didn't make it lose its edge.It's particularly impressive to note what a talented actor Louis C.K. is. As Louie he has established a likable, everyman persona that is a bit more sensitive and less confident than his stand-up persona. He plays a range of emotions in each episode, but the finale really puts his emotional range as an actor on full display. While it's hard to escape this scene's similarity to the conclusion of Woody Allen's Manhattan, it's a hilariously bittersweet ending that shows C.K. using some smart, subtle acting choices to convey his utter devastation.As a 20-year-old, I find it almost depressing how much I relate to C.K.'s material. That's what makes his stand-up and his show so wonderful. It connects with you on a level that only the best stand-up comedians are able to achieve; the material makes you laugh, it makes you think, and it makes you relate. Louis C.K. is a real auteur, handling all creative aspects of this show and making each episode on a shoestring budget. I think the lack of a cohesive narrative thread actually succeeds in making the show more interesting. With ease, it allows him to toy with emotions of the viewer and cover a broader range of subjects. I applaud Louis C.K. for this wonderful second season of his television opus, as well as FX for giving Louis the creative control that has made Louie one of the most unique, dynamic, and economical shows on television.", "term": "The Brilliant Second Season of 'Louie'", "id": "9879:1_0"}, "9880:1_0": {"polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Having been only a moderate Louis CK fan prior to catching Season One of FX's stellar \"Louie,\" I found the initial 13 episodes to be absolutely fantastic.  Without a doubt, this is his breakthrough moment and performance.  \"Louie\" expertly blends the mundane with the profane.  It can be awkward, hilarious and surprisingly real.  I thought Season One had some of television's biggest single laughs of the year as it juxtaposed comedy club footage with Louie just trying to be a good person, a good father, and a good comedian in everyday situations.  Oftentimes pushing past the edge of good taste, Louis CK leads you right into the crudest scenarios possible but never loses you.  This is a guy you can identify with and share in his frustrations and challenges. I feel like Louis CK really lets the viewer into his world and invites us to partake in the unified silliness of humanity.  Nominated for two 2011 Emmy Awards (one for writing, one as Best Actor in a Comedy), this show was also included on the American Film Institute's Best Program of the Year roster.So I was really looking forward to this second season.  I'm going to be honest.  In its totality, I don't think the show was quite as funny as last year.  But in many ways, the show deepened and became far more unexpected and interesting.  While still the champion of the awkward exchange, many episodes didn't play for laughs at all.  I'm not sure how others would compare this second season, but I found myself really respecting the chances that Louie CK took in his increasingly personal stories.  Some of the memorable moments include life lessons from Joan Rivers as well as Louie's continued painful pursuit of a relationship with Pamela Adlon.  But many of the episodes (including the season's loudest and most obnoxious entry about Louie's pregnant sister) defy categorization.  The show is unafraid of dealing with parenthood in a way few TV programs even attempt.  There is a quiet poignancy and truthfulness behind everything that happens.  What do you say when your daughter tells you she likes her mother better?  Well that's the question that opens the season.The 13 episodes on this 2 disc set are: (1) Pregnant, (2) Bummer/Blueberries, (3) Moving, (4) Joan, (5) Country Drive, (6) Subway/Pamela, (7) Oh Louie/Tickets, (8) Come On, God, (9) Eddie, (10) Halloween/Ellie, (11) Duckling, (12) Niece, (13) New Jersey/Airport.Some episodes have two vignettes, some are self contained stories.  More than anything, this season shows a confident and creative show runner willing to push the boundaries of conventional sitcom fare.  Without a doubt, my favorite of the year (one I'm convinced will be Emmy nominated) is the expanded episode \"Duckling\" which has Louie participating in a USO tour of Afghanistan.  It's a great set-up with lots of laughs that turns into one of the most heartfelt and memorable moments that I saw on TV this year.  Seriously.If you didn't love Season One of \"Louie,\" than this simply isn't a show for you.  Nothing here will change your mind.  As I stated, I didn't think this season had as many laugh-out-loud moments but it more than compensated by an increased depth and honesty.  It's strange to talk about a sitcom like that, but this is as close to real life as you're likely to see in a sitcom.

But I'm sure she was referring to LEVERAGE, and I was quick to counter her remark. Four seasons in for LEVERAGE, and, yeah, this is around when you start looking for signs of complacency or creakiness. Over time the show, for me, has achieved that \"comfort food\" status. It's one of the shows I turn to when I crawl in from a hard day's work. Four seasons in, LEVERAGE has still got teeth, still has freshness. I understand that there's a formula in play. But I'm still not tired of the act.Although, okay, if I must pick a nit, I think Aldis Hodge (\"Hardison\") is flirting with being too over-the-top with his urban cool mugging. I'm rolling my eyes so much, this old lady from Pechanga keeps yelling \"Jackpot!\"LEVERAGE tends to be an episodic series, although plot threads do surface which form a connective tissue and provide a measure of narrative continuity. In Season 4, our grifters are alerted to a bug in their apartment and ensuing episodes alert us of who's doing the spying and why. It pays off in the Season 4 finale. And, in the \"About Dang Time\" department, there's progression in the relationships between Hardison and Parker and between Nate and Sophie. In fact, romantic complications end up informing the development of a few of the heists. And, as usual, while there's intrigue in how those twisty heists are executed and in how those unexpected wrinkles are sidestepped, the true investment lies in watching the interactions amongst our five do-gooding grifters.Highlight episodes (for me, anyway):- \"The Ten Li'l Grifters Job\" - The team attends a murder mystery gala but, when a real homicide surfaces which implicates Nate, is forced to assume the role of a murder mystery organizing group.- \"The Boiler Room Job\" - The team goes after \"The Mako,\" an accomplished fellow con man and descendant of the legendary grifter, The Yellow Kid. Figuring that their target is too slick to con, they intend to just straight-up rob him.- \"The Cross My Heart Job\" - A crooked defense contractor steals a heart intended for a dying 15-year-old. To keep the organ from flying out, the team, handicapped without their usual tools, has to work up a caper to steal an airport under a two-hour deadline.- \"The Queen's Gambit Job\" - Interpol Agent Sterling recruits Nate's team to lift a nuclear centrifuge calibration weight from a maximum security highrise in Dubai during an international chess tournament. Are you ready for a humanizing moment for Sterling? Also, a nun gets coldcocked (okay, a fake nun).- \"The Office Job\" - Our grifters infiltrate a struggling greeting card company by posing as efficiency experts. But they didn't count on that documentary crew currently filming.- \"The Girls' Night Out Job\" - In the first of two overlapping episodes, Jeri Ryan returns as Parker, Sophie, and Tara (Ryan) cross paths with an international man of mystery.- \"The Boys' Night Out Job\" - In the second of two overlapping episodes, as the girls engage in an impromptu spy caper, Nate, Hardison, and Eliot have a dangerous reunion with lovable loser Jack Hurley (from Season 1's \"The 12-Step Job\") who again is in a jam with mobsters.- \"The Gold Job\" - When dishonest gold dealers show up on Nate Ford's radar, Hardison gets an opportunity to mastermind a team con.- \"The Radio Job\" - In the first of the two-part season finale, the crew breaks into a patent office, but, more importantly, when a hostage situation emerges and the fuzz show up, Eliot gets to channel John McClane from DIE HARD. Co-starring Tom Skerritt as Nate's dad, Jimmy Ford.- \"The Last Dam Job\" - Concludes the two-parter as a revenge-driven Nate is forced to recruit for backup as the team goes up against an old and formidable foe (featuring the return of past guest stars Richard Chamberlain, Wil Wheaton (who is awesome here!), Clayne Crawford, and Kari Matchett).

Frequently our mere existence is jeopardized by these artifacts. Down thru the ages of man, a Warehouse has existed to store these objects, located in that era's most powerful nation, with especially-trained Warehouse agents called upon to collect and safeguard them. Today's version, the vast Warehouse 13, sprawls somewhere in the blasted nowhereness of South Dakota. And while Warehouse Agents Myka Berry and Pete Lattimer may sometimes come off as goofballs, they're exceptional at their job. Season 3 retains the lightness and goofy humor, but maybe it's so as to catch you wholly unprepared for the crushing Sturm und Drang of the closing episodes. This season tremendously hoists up the quality and pushes the actors and their characters to someplace they've not yet been.Myka's emotional departure in the Season 2 finale has left the rest of the Warehouse 13 staff seriously gutted. In Season 3's opener, \"The New Guy,\" time has elapsed, time enough that it's been decided to recruit a new Warehouse agent, except that everyone still misses the fudge out of Myka. But in comes the very likable ATF agent Steve Jinks (Aaron Ashmore) who happens to be a human lie detector. He rapidly becomes close to the Warehouse's resident geek tech support Claudia. And here's the cool thing about this episode: There's no teasing about. By the end of this episode Myka has come back to the fold. I didn't think her daytime gig of prim bookstore clerk was gonna fly for too long.The spotlight shines brighter on the Regents, specially since the season's projected big bad - as embodied by the dangerous Anthony Michael Hall - nurses an unrelenting vendetta against them and the Warehouse. Awesomely, Kate Mulgrew plays one of the Regents and her character presents an unexpected link to an Agent. Of course, the Regents forfeit that patina of intimidation and infallibility once Walter Sykes (Hall) starts abducting them, torturing them, eliminating them. And Sykes' end game is damn diabolical, as we learn in the finale. Jaime Murray wonderfully reprises her role as H.G. Wells. And, in what looks to be a steady poaching of Star Trek actors, Jeri Ryan guest stars in the hilarious episode \"Queen for a Day\" and Ren&eacute; Auberjonois also returns to impede Artie's fledgling romance. Speaking of which, I've got the back of any show that reintroduces my childhood crush Lindsay Wagner.Absolutely there are highlight episodes. Like \"3...2...1,\" which deepens the show's mythology. \"3...2...1\" features Warehouse teams from three different eras attempting to corral the fabled trumpet what blew down the walls of Jericho. This episode also marks the return of H.G. Wells, as well as of Rebecca St. Clair and Jack Secord, the two Warehouse agents/starcrossed lovers from the 1960s (from \"Burnout\" and \"Where and When\"). What we get are three interweaving threads from, respectively, 1893, 1962, and the present day. Jaime Murray is outstanding in those flashbacks to 1893, in which we see her unleash all manner of steampunk asskickery as a Warehouse 12 agent in the British Empire. Step back, Lara Croft. See this ep and wonder no more about why there's rumor of Jaime Murray getting her own Warehouse 13 spin-off series.\"Don't Hate the Player\" is the crossover with EUREKA as the Warehouse agents must save Fargo who is stuck in a virtual reality game. In \"Past Imperfect,\" Myka achieves closure when she gets a second crack at the man who murdered her former Secret Service partner. \"Insatiable\" is a fun story revolving around an artifact that turns people into zombies (except that Pete is somehow immune). And how does the taco truck figure into this? Meanwhile, \"Love Sick\" concerns Artie, Claudia, Dr. Vanessa Calder (Lindsay Wagner) and Hugo Miller (Auberjonois) trying to neutralize an artifact that transforms people into clay. But never mind that plot. This episode also finds Pete and Myka waking up in bed together, stark nekkid and stricken with amnesia.But it's the two-part finale - \"Emily Lake\" and \"Stand\" - that kicks the chair out from under. It ties up a lot of loose ends but then creates several cliffhangers. The writers pull no punches on this one. It's a hefty roster of casualties, and you won't like that some of them what don't survive happen to be popular characters. Let's face it, in this universe, there are so many ways to get your ticket punched (even including Horrible Death by Chess Match!). I like a show that caters to tongue-in-cheek stories but then recognizes when it's time to get dark and grim and pregnant with pathos. And I like that this cast of actors gets challenged in their performances. Awesome Allison Scagliotti, the most natural actor in the series, has a field day chewing scenery. She can channel some truly raw emotions. Still, I watch this show primarily for Myka and Pete's interactions. Joanna Kelly and Eddie McClintock have got their rapport and patter down pat, but this time they also get put thru their paces. And in light of the explosive finale, I can't wait to see where Season 4 takes us. Season 4, where, hopefully, deaths are not a permanent state, there's another EUREKA crossover in store, and Allison Scagliotti sings and plays her guitar some more.Okay, the Season 3 closer is actually the terrific Christmas episode, \"The Greatest Gift.\" The plot - Pete activates an artifact that erases his existence - makes use of one of them tantalizing \"What if?\" scenarios and serves as a nod to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. What chance is there that this holiday ep makes it into the Season 3 DVD set release?", "term": "All I want for Christmas is a Farnsworth and a Tesla (and maybe Cecil B.

Although to me, this was very hokey, the actors did their best to pull it off instead of making it a complete spoof.  The last two episodes were pretty good and back on track.  Warehouse 13 has a very good and unique concept, and I would like to keep enjoying it for years.  The plots that can be written about are practically endless, given all the artifacts there are in the world.I recommend that the writers don't get into a rut with the plot always being the same, no matter what  artifact is being presented, while at the same time the writers ensure that the episodes don't get so far out that the plots are not relatable to most of the adults watching the series.  That's a fine line to walk sometimes, but Series 1 and 2 were able to do this.It is delightful to see more of Mrs. Fredrick and Claudia since they are both unique enough characters to be the sparkplugs that drive the mystique of each episode because both their characters are set up to do unpredictable things.  I hope Mrs. Fredrick doesn't become &#34;normal&#34; and continues to be mysterious.  The other three characters are more the anchors for the series, and it is always a pleasure when H.G. pops in as #4 to bring the uncertainty that this character gives to the series.For me, the mix is pretty perfect.
